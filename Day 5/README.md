# Day 5: Catching Up

## Reflection
 Today was all about catching up from all the activities I wasn't able to finish yesterday. 

 I started the day by finishing the Day 4 exercises, I actually learned a lot today like importing modules and files I created on my own,familiarize the functions in the documentation (I said familiarize because memorizing all the functions are unnecessary when this information can easily be found). I also learned about the data structure list and nested list in python. One thing that I wanted to comment on is the treasure map exercise, I just think that it could be confusing, I did not have a hard time on it but the course should make sure that they to use the common convention which is rows first then columns since they just introduced the concept of matrix or nested lists. Making the instructions that the columns are first then the rows are second on the input could confuse people and make it more harder when it's already hard. The final project was a rock paper scissors game, what I did was first get an input from the user (rock, paper or scissor) then generate a random number from 0 to 2 where 0 is rock, 1 is paper, 2 is scissors and finally just compare the two and show if the user won or not.

 On Day 5, I delved into control flow and logical operators in Python. Although the syntax of if/else statements differed slightly from what I was accustomed to, the real-life scenarios provided in the course helped me grasp them easily. Despite having prior knowledge in these areas, I appreciated the practical approach taken, which reinforced my understanding. The main exercise, "Treasure Island" was an engaging command-line game where users made choices and navigated through the gameplay.

 As for the final part of my coding session, I tackled the first exercise of Day 4 called "Heads or Tails." This program randomly prints either "Heads" or "Tails." To achieve this, I utilized the randint function from the random module to generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the result was 0, the program printed "Tails," and if it was 1, it printed "Heads."

 Looking back on the day, despite having a busy schedule, I'm satisfied with the progress I made. I acquired new knowledge, particularly about the random module in Python and that I remained committed to the coding challenge which is crucial for this to be successful. Consistency will continue to be the key to my success as I continue this coding journey, with 96 more days ahead of me.
