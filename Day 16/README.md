# Day 16: 
## Reflection
  I started today with Day 18, this section focuses on the built-in Turtle Graphics with a little bit of learning how to read documentations, using aliases and tuples. This is actually the first time since I started this where I am not familiar with what I'm learning but I was able to do it given that I already know how to read documentations since in school, we were only allowed to use C++ documentations for our lab activities. The challenges was actually not that easy, especially challenge 4 where it took me a while to realize my mistake that I need to use colormode to generate the random number and also I was using the object instead of the module to use the colormode() function. The final project was called Hirst Painting. Here is how I did mine
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 
  4. 
  5. 

  After that I also finished the Tuples part of the Python Intermediate certification

  Conclusion
  I only completed one section today in the 100 Days of Python but actually it was because there were more exercise compared to the previous one and the challenges and exercises are actually getting harder hence it takes me a long time especially that I am not familiar with it.


## Progress
 - Completed Day 18 of 100 Days of Python
 - Finished Tuples lesson in Python Intermediate on Sololearn
