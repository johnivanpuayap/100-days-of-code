# Day 16: Introduction to Turtle Graphics and Tuples 
## Reflection
  I started today with Day 18, this section focuses on the built-in Turtle Graphics with a little bit of learning how to read documentations, using aliases and tuples. This is actually the first time since I started this where I am not familiar with what I'm learning but I was able to do it given that I already know how to read documentations since in school, we were only allowed to use C++ documentations for our lab activities. The challenges was actually not that easy, especially challenge 4 where it took me a while to realize my mistake that I need to use colormode to generate the random number and also I was using the object instead of the module to use the colormode() function. The final project was called Hirst Painting. Here is how I did mine
  1. First is to install colorgram first using pip
  2. Edited the file path on the extract so that it works
  3. Create a random_color function that returns a random color from the colorgram output
  4. Create a Turtle and Screen object, set the color, speed on the turtle object and set colormode to 255 on the screen object
  5. Set the turtle's position at the top left
  6. Create a while loop that loops by decreasing the y coordinate till it reaches the bottom edge of the screen
  7. Create an inner loop that loops by increasing the x coordinate till it reaches the right edge of the screen
  8. On the inner loop we will print a dot, and uses the random_color method to create it's color.
  9. Set an exitonclick() for the screen

  This was actually a fun project, the hard part for me was making sure the colorgram works since I am not using Pycharm and trying to make the distance between the edges and the circles on both ends nearly equal and since the x and y coordinates is based on the center like a cartesian plane, i am actually not used to it anymore since I am used to 0,0 at the top right. 

  After that I also finished the Tuples part of the Python Intermediate certification. What I mainly learned is that values of tuples can't be change so can consider it like a final data structure.

  Conclusion
  Today I completed one section in the 100 Days of Python but actually it was because there were more exercise compared to the previous one and the challenges and exercises are actually getting harder hence it takes me a long time especially that I am not familiar with it.


## Progress
 - Completed Day 18 of 100 Days of Python
 - Finished Tuples and Tuples Unpacking lesson in Python Intermediate on Sololearn
