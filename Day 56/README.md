# Day 56: Mastering Static File Rendering and Using Website Templates

## Reflection

Today, I began Day 56 of my 100 Days of Python journey. This lesson focused on integrating static files into a website, properly rendering HTML and CSS files, and gaining an understanding of rendering templates. As the culminating task, I created a simple name card website featuring my contact details and relevant links, such as LinkedIn and GitHub. This was achieved by utilizing a template and leveraging Flask to facilitate the process.

Subsequently, I delved into learning how to address the issues I encountered with Git revert and reset. The problem arose when I merged a new commit of my Personal Site, which already utilized the Flask framework, into the main branch. Unfortunately, the GitHub pages were not functioning as intended, as they exclusively support static websites.

In summary, Day 56 offered a comprehensive learning experience. With 44 days remaining, I'm excited to continue enhancing my proficiency on this journey.
