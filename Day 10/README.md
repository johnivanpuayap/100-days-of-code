# Day 10: Being Comfortable with the Uncomfortable
## Reflection
 Today, I started on improving my Survey Form on the Web Design Certification. My submission before was mainly on HTML since they don't check the CSS. I honestly realized that if I was doing only the html part with a little bit of CSS, this course will do nothing so I tried to make the project not only functionality similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks but also similar design wise.

 Since, I am not really good when it comes to CSS, I honestly had a hard time trying to make a similar copy but I still made sure to finish it. One thing I learned before is that when you want to work as a software engineer, you need to be comfortable with the uncomfortable since working as a software engineer means that you need to also study and keep up to the latest technologies. When you start working, there will always be work that you're not gonna be comfortable with but being able to comfortable with the uncomfortable can help you tackle it on. 

 Honestly, I always feel anxious when I am having a hard time on something. Like, I have this feeling that I am uncomfortable, my feet feels something, I'm also scared and overwhelmed about the task that I am doing and I just wanna stop doing it. But, after a lot of practicing albeit I am still not over it and I am still experiencing it, I am doing a little bit better when I am experiencing it. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do this challenge.
 
 After resting, I started doing Day 10 of 100 Day of Python. This section focused on dictionaries and nesting lists and dictionaries. I found dictionaries in Python to be similar to hash tables or hash maps in other programming languages. I didn't encounter any difficulties so far and smoothly completed the exercises.

 The main project for today involved building a silent auction program. Once you understand how dictionaries work, it's actually quite simple. Here's an overview of how I approached it:

 1. I started by creating an empty dictionary and then implemented a while loop that continues until there are no more bidders.
 2. Within the loop, I asked the user for their name and bid, and then added them to the dictionary as key-value pairs.
 3. Once there are no more bidders (when the user indicates so), I used the max function to find the highest bidder. I researched and learned that a lambda function is needed to use max with dictionaries. Before incorporating the code, I ensured I understood how it worked.
 4. Finally, I printed the highest bidder's details.

 That's all there is to it. While it's also possible to find the highest bidder using a for loop, I discovered that max is more efficient since it's implemented in C. I acknowledge that for small input sizes, this efficiency gain may not be significant. However, I believe it's beneficial to be aware of more efficient approaches, similar to using a StringBuilder to concatenate strings in Java instead of the + operator. It's useful to practice and become familiar with such methods, especially since once you become a software engineer, you will be working on larger input sizess.
