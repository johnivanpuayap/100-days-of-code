# Day 10: Embracing the Uncomfortable: Progress in Web Design and Python
## Reflection
 Today, I dedicated my efforts to enhancing my Survey Form for the Web Design Certification. While my previous submission focused mainly on HTML, I realized that to truly benefit from this course, I needed to delve deeper into CSS. Striving for both functionality and design similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks, I encountered challenges due to my limited CSS skills. However, I persisted and completed the project. This experience reinforced the importance of being comfortable with the uncomfortable as a software engineer. To succeed in this field, one must continually learn and adapt to emerging technologies. Embracing discomfort enables us to tackle unfamiliar tasks confidently.

 I must admit, when faced with difficulties, anxiety tends to cloud my mind. Uncomfortable sensations arise, and I feel tempted to give up. Despite this ongoing struggle, I have noticed gradual improvement through consistent practice. Thus, I embarked on this challenge not only to push myself but also to foster a sense of comfort in uncomfortable situations.
 
 After resting, I delved into Day 10 of the 100 Days of Python journey. This section focused on functions with outputs, covering topics such as multiple returns, combining dictionaries and functions, and a little bit of recursion. Recursion, in particular, has been a challenging concept for me to grasp, and I still occasionally struggle to implement it effectively.

 The main project for today involves a calculator (one operation at a time only). Here is how did it:
 1. Define the functions for the calculator operations.
 2. Define a dictionary named "operations" with operation symbols as keys and corresponding function names as values.
 3. Write code to prompt the user for the first number, second number, and the desired operation.
 4. Create a variable to store the function associated with the chosen operation by retrieving it from the "operations" dictionary based on the user input.
 5. Perform the calculation using the selected function and display the result.
 6. Modify the code to repeatedly ask for the second number until the user chooses to exit. Make sure to update the first number in each iteration.
 8. Include an option to restart the calculation by incorporating the code within the function and calling it again when the user wants to start over.
 9. Add an else condition to exit the calculator when any other character is pressed. Ensure to set the variable controlling the while loop in the initial instance of the calculator function to false, allowing us to exit both the current calculator and the outer while loop.
 10. Add modulo operator for fun

 I decided to include an exit option as it was missing in the original project requirements and also incorporated the modulo operator.

 Conclusion:

 What a day it has been! I initially faced challenges with CSS, an area I've been keen on improving since last semester when I struggled a bit on one of my final project. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that practice and perseverance are the keys to success. Although I may never become an expert, developing decent CSS skills will benefit me, especially as I aspire to build a personal website and blog alongside my focus on back-end development. Afterward, I tackled Day 10 of the 100 Days of Python course, which went smoothly. I even expanded on the final project by adding more functions. With 90 more days ahead in this journey, I am excited to keep improving as I go through on this journey."
