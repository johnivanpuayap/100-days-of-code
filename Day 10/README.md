# Day 10: Being Comfortable with the Uncomfortable
## Reflection
 Today, I started on improving my Survey Form on the Web Design Certification. My submission before was mainly on HTML since they don't check the CSS. I honestly realized that if I was doing only the html part with a little bit of CSS, this course will do nothing so I tried to make the project not only functionality similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks but also similar design wise.

 Since, I am not really good when it comes to CSS, I honestly had a hard time trying to make a similar copy but I still made sure to finish it. One thing I learned before is that when you want to work as a software engineer, you need to be comfortable with the uncomfortable since working as a software engineer means that you need to also study and keep up to the latest technologies. When you start working, there will always be work that you're not gonna be comfortable with but being able to comfortable with the uncomfortable can help you tackle it on. 

 Honestly, I always feel anxious when I am having a hard time on something. Like, I have this feeling that I am uncomfortable, my feet feels something, I'm also scared and overwhelmed about the task that I am doing and I just wanna stop doing it. But, after a lot of practicing albeit I am still not over it and I am still experiencing it, I am doing a little bit better when I am experiencing it. This is why I wanted to do this challenge, to challenge myself as well as be comfortable with the uncomfortable.
 
 After resting, I started doing Day 10 of 100 Day of Python. This section focused on functions with outputs and also covered topics like multiple returns, combining dictionaries and functions as well as recursion. Recursion is actually one of the things that I had a hard time understanding, even still now, I can easily get confused and can sometimes not implement a recursion properly.

 The main project for today involves a calculator (one operation at a time only). Here is how did it:

 1. Define the functions for the calculator operations.
 2. Define a dictionary named "operations" with operation symbols as keys and corresponding function names as values.
 3. Write code to prompt the user for the first number, second number, and the desired operation.
 4. Create a variable to store the function associated with the chosen operation by retrieving it from the "operations" dictionary based on the user input.
 5. Perform the calculation using the selected function and display the result.
 6. Modify the code to repeatedly ask for the second number until the user chooses to exit. Make sure to update the first number in each iteration.
 8. Include an option to restart the calculation by incorporating the code within the function and calling it again when the user wants to start over.
 9. Add an else condition to exit the calculator when any other character is pressed. Ensure to set the variable controlling the while loop in the initial instance of the calculator function to false, allowing us to exit both the current calculator and the outer while loop.
 10. Add modulo operator for fun

 I actually added the exit since the requirement main project didn't have one and also added the modulo operator.

 Conclusion
