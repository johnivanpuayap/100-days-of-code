# Day 42: Intermediate HTML and Github Pages

## Reflection
  Today's focus was Day 42 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, delving into intermediate HTML concepts like forms and tables. I completed two exercises involving an HTML table for showcasing skills and a contact form to enhance my CV Website project from yesterday. By the end of the session, I successfully learned how to publish a website using GitHub Pages and utilized it to share my CV Website.

  As it was a weekend, I concluded the day early to prepare for the Philnits Exam. With 58 days remaining in my 100 Days of Python journey, I am filled with eagerness and excitement for the upcoming learning opportunities and growth. Onwards to more thrilling coding adventures!
