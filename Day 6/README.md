# Day 6: Starting the Review

## Reflection
 Today is a weekend hence I need to dedicate most of my time to reviewing topics in preparation for the PhilNits Exam and my classes next semester. I started by taking a past Philnits FE AM Exam, randomly selecting the 2017 version. Unfortunately, I scored only 25% (20 out of 80), which was quite disheartening. While I have prior knowledge on most computer science-related topics, I really need to review them and also there were some management questions that I was really clueless about. To address this, I decided to start my review with discrete math since it has been several years since I last studied it. Interestingly, I actually failed Discrete Math 2, but managed to earn a 4.0 on my second attempt, which was just enough for a removal exam that thankfully I was able to pass.

 Moving on to my progress in the "100 Days of Python" challenge, Day 6 focused on functions and while loops. Although I understand how they work, I still need to familiarize myself with the syntax. For this particular day, I didn't have any files to upload as the exercises were based on Reeborg's World, an online platform that doesn't function offline.

 Conclusion
 Today, I realized the need to review various topics, particularly Discrete Math, which I haven't touched upon in a long time. Given that the passing rate for the PhilNits Exam is around 30%, it is very important to make an extra effort and to start slowly reviewing now even if my plan is taking it on May or October 2024. Thankfully, I am highly motivated right now that I even decided that I want to exert more effort this school year since I am already past my transition period from not studying at all for the last 3 years which was definitely hard actually knowing that I am a person who is easily distracted and is forgetful. With 94 days remaining, I am determined to make the most out of this challenge.

## Progress
 - Took a preliminary exam before I started my review on PhilNits
 - Created a Reviewer and started reviewing logic gates
 - Completed Day 6 of 100 Days of Python
 - Progressed a little on the Introduction to Python Course by Sololearn
