# Day 31: Flashcard App
## Reflection
  Today, for Day 31 of my 100 Days of Python challenge, I worked on a Flashcard app as a capstone project. I had previously completed a similar project in school called [SmartCard](https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/SmartCards), which was a flashcard app implementing the Leitner system for effective spaced repetition to enhance learning.

  Since the purpose of the 100 Days of Code challenge is to improve my skills, I decided to add new features to the app to challenge myself and learn something new. Here are the new features I implemented:
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 

  After completing the Flashcard App, I continued making progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification. I started the "Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting" section, where I explored topics such as SVG icons, CSS positioning, and reviewed my CSS skills.

  Overall, it was an incredibly productive day, igniting a renewed sense of accomplishment and determination as I look ahead to the remaining 69 days of the challenge, excited to undertake fresh projects and further refine my Python and web development expertise.
