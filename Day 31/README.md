# Day 31: Flashcard App
## Reflection
  Today, I started doing Day 31 of 100 Days of Python which is a capstone project. What I needed to create was a FlashCard app, which is something I already done a similar project before in school named [SmartCard](https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/SmartCards), a flashcard app that utilizes the Leitner system, enabling users to review and enhance their learning through effective spaced repetition.

  Since 100 Days of Code is all about improving my skills and I am already familiar with what needed to be done, what I did was add new features to challenge me and so that I can learn something new. Here are the new features that I added:

  After finishing the FlashCard App, I made progress on the Responsive Web Design Certificate by starting the Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting, where I learned all about about SVG icons, CSS positioning, and also review the CSS skills I've learned.

  Today was a productive day! 69 days to go!
