# Day 31: Building a Flashcard Learning App
## Reflection
  On Day 31 of my 100 Days of Python challenge, I embarked on developing a Flashcard app to learn French, marking the third capstone project in this coding journey. Building on my previous project called SmartCard from school, which implemented the Leitner system for spaced repetition, I challenged myself to further improve my skills and incorporate new features.

  The additional features I implemented were:
  1. Automatic reloading of words from french_words.csv when there are no more words left to learn in words_to_learn.csv.
  2. Displaying progress tracking for the session.
  
  Beyond completing the Flashcard App, I made steady progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification, specifically in the "Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting" section. Here, I explored topics such as SVG icons, CSS positioning, and took the opportunity to review and enhance my CSS skills.

  This day proved to be incredibly productive, fueling a renewed sense of accomplishment and determination as I eagerly anticipate the upcoming 69 days of the challenge. I am excited to take on fresh projects and further refine my Python and web development expertise.
