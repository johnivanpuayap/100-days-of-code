# Day 4: Balancing Busy Schedules and Coding Consistency

## Reflection
Today was a busy day as I attended a wedding where I had the honor of being a groomsman. I actually contemplated skipping my coding practice for the day. However, I reminded myself that it was only day 4, and achieving mastery in coding, much like going to the gym, requires consistency and perseverance.

Upon returning home at 8:00 pm, I decided to try learning as much as possible for 2 hoyurs. I focused on completing two modules from the Introduction to Python course: "Getting Started" and "Going Deeper." These modules covered important topics like variables, data types, input, and printing. They provided a valuable opportunity to reinforce my understanding of concepts I had learned in the previous days.

As for the final part of my coding session, I tackled the first exercise of Day 4 called "Heads or Tails." This program randomly prints either "Heads" or "Tails." To achieve this, I utilized the randint function from the random module to generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the result was 0, the program printed "Tails," and if it was 1, it printed "Heads."

Looking back on the day, despite having a busy schedule, I'm satisfied with the progress I made. I acquired new knowledge, particularly about the random module in Python and that I remained committed to the coding challenge which is crucial for this to be successful. Consistency will continue to be the key to my success as I continue this coding journey, with 96 more days ahead of me.
