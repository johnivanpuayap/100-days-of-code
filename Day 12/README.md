# Day 12: 
## Reflection
 Today, I began my learning on Day 12 of the 100 Days of Python. This section focuses on Namespace, Scopes and Python Constants. I also learned about Global Scope vs Local Scope. I also learned that block scope

 Final Project for this section is the Number Guessing Game. Here is how I did mine
 1. 

 After finishing Day 12, I decided to make some progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification. The current section I'm doing is focuses on CSS and the Box Model of HTML.

 Conclusion
 To be honest my motivation to do things today was very low and I just did a lot of things like preparing things for my vacation this week. While, I was able to finish the Day 12, I might need to refactored code tomorrow for this day.

## Progress
 - Completed Day 12 of 100 Days of Python
 - Made some progress on Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting
