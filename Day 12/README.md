# Day 12: Python Namespaces and Number Guessing Game
## Reflection
 On Day 12 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, I delved into the concept of Namespaces. It was interesting to discover that Python doesn't have block scope, unlike languages such as C++ or Java. Variables created inside if/else/for/while code blocks have either a global scope or a local scope (if created inside a function).

 For the final project of this section, I implemented the Number Guessing Game. Here's a breakdown of my approach:

 1. Printed a welcome message and asked the user for their preferred difficulty.
 2. Generated a random number between 1 and 1000 and initialized a variable called "lives."
 3. Set the number of lives to 10 or 5, depending on the chosen difficulty.
 4. Created a while loop that runs as long as lives are not equal to 0.
 5. Inside the while loop, prompted the user for their guess:
    a. If the guess was greater than the random number, printed "too high."
    b. If the guess was lesser, printed "too low."
    c. If the guess was correct, printed a victory message and broke out of the while loop.
    d. If the guess was out of bounds, continued to the next iteration.
 6. Finally, if lives reached zero after the while loop, the user lost the game.

 This game was actually a fun exercise that allowed me to apply my newfound knowledge effectively.

 In addition to my Python progress, I made some headway in the Responsive Web Design Certification, specifically focusing on CSS and the Box Model of HTML. Although fatigue set in, I managed to make noteworthy progress before calling it a day.

 Conclusion
 While my motivation levels were low today, I embraced the opportunity to tackle other tasks and prepare for my upcoming vacation this week. Despite the challenges, I successfully completed Day 12 and gained valuable insights. As I continue my journey, I look forward to refactoring my code and facing new coding adventures. With 88 more days to go, I'm excited about the future learning opportunities that lie ahead.
