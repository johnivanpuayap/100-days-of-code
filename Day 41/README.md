# Day 41: A Review of HTML

## Reflection
  Today, there was still no internet, leaving me in a bit of a predicament. Nevertheless, I decided to try my mobile data as a workaround, but unfortunately, it proved to be painfully slow. Despite the connectivity challenges, I was relieved to find that today's lesson was relatively easier than expected. It primarily involved watching educational videos on various topics, such as how the internet functions, the mechanics of websites, and an in-depth look into HTML. Fortunately, I had prior experience with HTML, having taken a course on it before. Additionally, it was a fundamental part of my journey through The Odin Project and was also covered in the Responsive Web Design Certification course.

  As the day progressed, I made the decision to wrap up my work early, as the sluggish internet speed made it difficult to accomplish much. Instead, I dedicated some time to review my knowledge in preparation for the upcoming PhilNits examination, which I'm eager to excel in.

  Despite the internet setbacks, I am determined to continue my 100 Days of Python challenge. With 59 days remaining, I remain enthusiastic about this wonderful learning journey that has enriched my skills and knowledge.
