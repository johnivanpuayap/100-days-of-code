# Day 41: A Review on HTML

## Reflection
  There was still no internet for today, I decided to try my mobile data but it is really slow, luckily, today's lesson was a bit easier since it is all about HTML and I already took a course on it and was also a part of the Responsive Web Design Certification.

  Then, I decided to wrap up my work for the day since I have to review for PhilNits and the internet is still slow. 59 days to go on this wonderful learning journey!
