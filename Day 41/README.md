# Day 41: A Review of HTML

## Reflection
  Today presented a challenge with no internet access, but I persevered and managed to use my mobile data, even though it was frustratingly slow. Nevertheless, the lesson on HTML was familiar to me, and the final project involved creating a simple personal site to showcase my CV.

  Despite the connectivity issues, I made the wise decision to wrap up work early, acknowledging that it's better to focus on quality learning rather than battling with a sluggish connection. I dedicated some time to review my knowledge, preparing for the upcoming PhilNits examination, where I aim to excel.

  Despite the setbacks, I remain determined to continue the 100 Days of Python challenge, with 59 days remaining. This journey has been incredibly enriching, enhancing both my skills and knowledge.
