# Day 27: 

## Reflection
  
  Today, I started reviewing the OOP concept on Python through going through the OOP Module of Python Intermediate on Sololearn. I also managed to learn new stuff like magic methods, which are methods that have double underscores at the beginning and at the end and operator overloading, which uses the same concept of overloading in OOP but instead of functions, it overrides operators like +, -, *, /, etc.

  Then, I moved on to completing Day 27 of 100 Days of Python, where I learned to create GUI programs using tkinter and learned more about **args and **kwargs and also created a unit converter program with a GUI.

  I ended the day by completing the Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet by completing the CSS part of the project.

  Conclusion
