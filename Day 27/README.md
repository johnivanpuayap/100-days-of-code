# Day 27: Working with the Tkinter Library

## Reflection
  Today, I started by reviewing the OOP concepts in Python through the OOP Module of Python Intermediate on Sololear Additionally, I learned new topics such as magic methods, which are methods enclosed with double underscores at the beginning and end, and operator overloading. Operator overloading involves overriding operators like +, -, *, /, etc., using the same concept of overloading in OOP but with operators instead of functions.

  After that, I moved on to completing Day 27 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, where I delved into the tkinter module. I learned how to create windows and use components such as labels, buttons, and spinboxes. Furthermore, I explored the layout managers in Tkinter, including pack, place, and grid, and understood the advantages of using each one. I also expanded my knowledge of positional arguments, optional arguments, **args (unlimited positional arguments), and **kwargs (unlimited keyword arguments). Lastly, I applied all the knowledge gained to create a mile-to-kilometers converter, serving as the final project for the day.

  I wrapped up the day by completing the CSS part of the project "Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet."

  Overall, today was incredibly exciting, and I made significant progress in my learning journey. With 73 more days to go, I'm eagerly looking forward to continuing this learning adventure.
