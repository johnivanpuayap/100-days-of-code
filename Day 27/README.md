# Day 27: Working with the Tkinter Library

## Reflection
  Today, I started reviewing the OOP concept on Python through going through the OOP Module of Python Intermediate on Sololearn. I also managed to learn new stuff like magic methods, which are methods that have double underscores at the beginning and at the end and operator overloading, which uses the same concept of overloading in OOP but instead of functions, it overrides operators like +, -, *, /, etc.

  Then, I moved on to completing Day 27 of 100 Days of Python, where I learned the tkinter module, how to create windows and also how to use components like label, button, spinbox, etc. I also expanded my knowledge about positional arguments and optional arguments and **args (also known as unlimited positional arguments) and **kwargs (also known as unlimited keyword arguments). Lastly I created a mile to kilometers converter which was the final project for today, where I applied all of the stuff I learned about the Tkinter module.

  I ended the day by completing the Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet by completing the CSS part of the project.
