# Day 2 - Setting Up and Starting the Grind

## Reflection
Today, I started my personal development challenge by focusing on setting up my development environment. I began by installing PyCharm and Python on my device. Although I encountered a minor setback during the installation process by overlooking the "add to PATH variables" step, I recognized the valuable lesson in learning from mistakes, even if it cost me 30 minutes of troubleshooting.

In parallel, I embarked on the 100 Days of Python course led by Dr. Angela Yu and completed Day 1. Given my prior programming experience, the exercises for the day were relatively straightforward. However, I made the decision to start from the beginning of the course to reinforce my knowledge, aligning this approach with my ongoing pursuit of the Responsive Web Design Certification. My plan is to complete the web design certification before diving into the intermediate Python material, allowing me to dedicate my full attention to the Python course.

Speaking of the Responsive Web Design Certification, I successfully finished the Learn Basic CSS section. Initially underestimating the simplicity of this task, I've come to appreciate the importance of practicing even the fundamental concepts when learning a programming language. Despite considering myself more inclined towards backend development, I acknowledge the significance of taking HTML and CSS seriously, as proficiency in these areas enhances collaboration and communication with front-end developers.

Moreover, I delved into a PDF resource titled "12 Rules to Learn to Code" that provided valuable insights. I learned about the 20-minute rule, the habit of chunking, and the benefits of analyzing and debugging someone else's code. I highly recommend this resource, particularly to beginners and students. Additionally, I want to emphasize the importance of supplementing practical learning with reading books and watching coding videos. These additional sources, especially CodeAesthetic's videos, have greatly contributed to my growth throughout my learning journey.

Overall, the second day of my personal development challenge was filled with setting up my environment, diving into Python and CSS coursework, and exploring insightful reading material. I'm excited to continue this journey of growth and development over the next 98 days.
