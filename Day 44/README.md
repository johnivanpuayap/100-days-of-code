# Day 44: Intermediate CSS - Personal Website Upgrade

## Reflection

As I reached Day 44 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, a significant chapter came to a close within the Web Foundation phase. This marked a pivotal moment where I undertook the task of refining and enhancing my personal website, ultimately deploying it on GitHub Pages. The voyage to this accomplishment was not without its challenges, especially in navigating the intricacies of CSS design â€“ an area where I'm still honing my skills. Despite the extended duration this endeavor took, I'm pleased with the outcome. In fact, I've chosen to elevate this upgraded iteration to serve as my interim portfolio website. With time, I intend to cultivate it further, adapting its responsiveness and perhaps even conceiving an entirely new design.

The process of crafting a personal website has been a stimulating journey, infusing each step with exhilaration. Crossing this milestone off my goals list radiated a profound sense of accomplishment. Subsequently, I opted for a slightly shorter day to accommodate some material review and other commitments. Yet, the anticipation of the 56 days that remain in this challenge has me brimming with enthusiasm. I eagerly anticipate the days ahead, poised to refine my coding prowess and augment my personal website to new heights. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this coding journey!y!
