# Day 44: Intermediate CSS - Personal Website Upgrade

## Reflection

Today marked the completion of Day 44 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, which was the last day of the Web Foundation phase. The primary focus of this project was to create an improved personal website and deploy it on GitHub Pages. I made the decision to use this upgraded version as my temporary portfolio website, with plans to further enhance it as my skills and confidence grow.

The process of creating a personal website was truly exhilarating, and achieving this milestone brought a great sense of fulfillment. Checking it off my checklist of goals was a rewarding moment for me. Afterwards, I decided to end the day a bit early, as I had to review some materials and we also had some other plans. However, I'm excited to continue the journey with 56 more days left in the challenge. I look forward to the upcoming days and the opportunity to further refine my coding skills and enhance my personal website. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this coding journey!
