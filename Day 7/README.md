# Day 7: Hangman Project

## Reflection
 Today was a busy day for me as my family and I visited the Saint Claire Monastery in Mondragon and went to Catarman to purchase tickets for our trip to Cebu on the 18th. Consequently, I had limited time and felt a bit tired upon returning home.

 Fortunately, Day 7 primarily focused on reviewing the lessons learned during the past week. The final project for today was a Hangman game. Here's how I approached it:
 1. Generate a random word.
 2. Create a list of underscores of the same length as the random word.
 3. Ask the user to input a character.
 4. If the user's character matched a character from the generated word, update the list to show the character
 5. If the user's character didn't match, I decremented the user's lives.
 6. If the user managed to guess the full word before running out of lives, they won; otherwise, they lost.
 
 Conclusion
 Today presented a significant challenge for me, not because of the project itself, but due to my fatigue from traveling and my usual preference to relax on Sundays. Nonetheless, I was determined to complete this challenge, so I managed to finish Day 7 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. With 93 days remaining, I remain motivated to persevere and continue on this journey!
