# Day 7: Hangman Project

## Reflection
 Today was a busy day for me as my family visited the Saint Claire Monastery in Mondragon and also went on Catarman. Consequently, I didn't have much time and felt a bit tired.

 Fortunately, Day 7 was mainly focused on reviewing the lessons learned during the past week. The final project for today was a Hangman game. Here's how I approached it:

 1. Generated a random word.
 2. Created a string of underscores of the same length as the random word.
 3. Asked the user to input a character.
 4. If the user's character matched a character from the generated word, I revealed those letters.
 5. If the user's character didn't match, I decremented their remaining lives.
 6. If the user managed to guess the full word before running out of lives, they won; otherwise, they lost.
 
 Conclusion
 Today was quite challenging for me, given that I was tired from traveling and usually prefer to relax on Sundays. However, I was determined to complete Day 7 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. With 93 days left, I'm motivated to push through and continue the journey!
