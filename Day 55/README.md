# Day 55: Mastering Flask - HTML, URLs, and Decorators

## Reflection

Today on Day 55 of 100 Days of Python, I deepened my understanding of Flask. I learned about rendering HTML, parsing URLs, and advanced decorators. These concepts are crucial for web development with Flask.

In HTML rendering, I grasped how to seamlessly integrate HTML templates into Flask. Parsing URLs taught me to personalize user experiences effectively. Advanced decorators, a powerful Python feature, allowed me to enhance function capabilities.

Putting my skills to work, I did an exercise on creating decorators that styles an HTML tag and an exercise to create a decorator that prints the function name. Lastly, I developed a Flask-powered web version of the Higher Lower Game. As a personal challenge, I added a custom decorator to validate numeric inputs within a specific range.

With Day 55 completed, I'm excited about the remaining 45 days of the challenge. Flask has opened up a world of possibilities in web development.
