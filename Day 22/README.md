# Day 21: 

## Reflection
  For today, I decided to take a break from the 100 Days of Python since I am one day ahead and wanted to focus on the Responsive Web Design Certification. My initial goal was to finish it before moving on to the intermediate part of the 100 Days of Python, but I am already halfway through the intermediate part. Thus, I dedicated this day to making as much progress as possible on the certification.

  I began my day by completing the "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" section. During this section, I learned about accessibility tools like keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices. Although I still need to familiarize myself with some CSS properties and occasionally resort to googling, I view this as an opportunity to practice and improve my web development skills.

  The next section involved creating a tribute page, which was one of the Certification Projects. While the certification did not require an exact match, I challenged myself to make it closely resemble the example tribute page. This project took several hours, but I managed to complete it without using the inspect button on Chrome.

  Conclusion
  Overall, Day 21 was focused on the Responsive Web Design Certification and refactoring my Pong Game code. I made progress by finishing the "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" section and completing the Certification Project #2 Tribute Page. This day allowed me to enhance my understanding of accessibility in web development and apply my skills to create a tribute page.

  ## Progress
