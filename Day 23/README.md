# Day 23: The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project
## Reflection
  Today, I made significant progress on the Turtle Crossing Capstone Project. Drawing from my experience with the Snake Game and the Pong Game, I found this project to be relatively straightforward. Not only did I successfully complete the project, but I also added additional features to enhance and personalize the game. For instance, I implemented a Title Screen that greets players when they start the game.

  In addition to the capstone project, I also covered recursion and learned about *args and **kwargs in the Python Intermediate section. I now understand how *args can be used as a function parameter to allow for a variable number of arguments, while **kwargs enables the handling of named arguments that were not predefined.

  Lastly, I made progress in my Responsive Web Design Certification by delving into CSS Pseudo Selectors. I started this project by creating the HTML structure for a Balance Sheet.
  
  Conclusion

  Today was a productive day where I made significant progress on multiple fronts. I successfully completed the Turtle Crossing Capstone Project, I deepened my understanding of recursion and explored the versatility of *args and **kwargs in Python Intermediate
  Today, and I advanced my web development skills. With 77 days remaining in my 100 Days of Code challenge, I am motivated to maintain this momentum and continue learning and growing as a programmer. The journey so far has been rewarding, and I look forward to the progress I will make in the days ahead.
