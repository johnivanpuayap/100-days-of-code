# Day 25: Exploring CSV Files and Creating an Educational Game

## Reflection
  Today, I dedicated my efforts to completing Day 25 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. I made significant progress and acquired valuable knowledge along the way. One of the key concepts I learned today was how to read and write data from CSV files, as well as exploring the methods of the Pandas library as well as data structures like the Data Frame and Series.

  For the final project of the day, I developed an engaging educational game that allows users to guess and learn about all the states in the US. This project proved to be an exciting and rewarding experience.

  I ended the day by finishing the Module 2 Quiz on Python Intermediate. The questions covered topics such as functional programming, lambdas, map & filters, generators, decorators, recursion, and *args and **kwargs.

  As the challenge progresses, I've noticed the increasing complexity of the lessons. Although it may be challenging to complete a substantial amount of work each day, I remain dedicated to accomplishing at least one section per day. Despite any limitations, I persist in making consistent progress. Thankfully, I successfully completed the project for today, adding to my sense of achievement.

  Conclusion
  
  Day 25 proved to be an enriching and rewarding experience. I expanded my skills in working with CSV files and grasped the potential of the Pandas library for data manipulation. The development of an interactive educational game added a practical dimension to my learning journey. Additionally, completing the Module 2 Quiz on Python Intermediate helped solidify my understanding of important programming concepts. With only 75 days remaining in the challenge, I am motivated and determined to continue pushing forward, mastering Python, and achieving my goals.
