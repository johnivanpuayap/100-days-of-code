# Day 25: Exploring CSV Files and Creating an Educational Game

## Reflection
  TToday, I dedicated my efforts to completing Day 25 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. I made significant progress and acquired valuable knowledge along the way. One of the key concepts I learned today was how to read and write data from CSV files, as well as exploring the methods of the Pandas library.

  For the final project of the day, I developed an engaging educational game that allows users to guess and learn about all the states in the US. This project proved to be an exciting and rewarding experience.

  While I recognize that the difficulty level of the lessons continues to increase as the challenge progresses, I remain committed to my goal of completing at least one section per day. Although I may not accomplish as much as I'd like, I consistently strive to make progress. Fortunately, I was able to successfully complete the project for today.
