# Day 25:

## Reflection
  Today, I was set on finishing Day 25 of 100 Days of Python. I learned a lot especially on working with data files and the Pandas library.

  The final project for today is creating an educational game that lets user guess and learn all the states in the US.
  
  As the days or lesson pass by, it gets more harder for me, which is why I may not be able to finish a lot but nevertheless, I am still making sure to try and finish one section per day as long as I can. Luckily, I think I finished the project today.

  Conclusion

  ## Progress
  - Completed Day 25 of 100 Days of Python
