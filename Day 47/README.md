# Day 47: Creating an Automated Amazon Price Tracker

## Reflection
  Today, I started with Day 47, where I created an automated amazon price tracker. Next, I finished the working with Files module of Python Intermediate, it's actually the last module and I actually have learned all of it already on Day 24, so this module just basically served as a review, so I didn't have a hard time and finaly completed the Python Intermediate Course. Here is my [certificate](https://www.sololearn.com/certificates/CC-ZHQFMUNW)
  

## Progress
