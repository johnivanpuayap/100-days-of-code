# Day 47: Building an Automated Amazon Price Tracker

## Reflection

On Day 47, I undertook the exciting task of developing an automated Amazon price tracker. The project involved extracting product details such as title and price from an Amazon URL, and subsequently triggering an email notification when the price fell within a predefined budget. While the project proved to be relatively straightforward, I took the opportunity to enhance its functionality through the following refinements:

1. Dynamic Captcha Handling: I implemented a feature to detect the presence of Captcha HTML, ensuring the program retries if encountered, thus enhancing its robustness.
2. Alternate HTML Parsing: To accommodate varying webpage layouts, I introduced a secondary check of price for an alternative HTML structure.
3. Optimized Price Retrieval: I included an early exit mechanism that gracefully handles situations where the price information is not located.

In addition to the Amazon price tracker, I also wrapped up the Python Intermediate Course by revisiting the Files module. Although this section was largely a review since I had covered its content on Day 24, it provided a valuable opportunity for reinforcement. With this, I have now successfully completed the entire Python Intermediate Course, marking a significant milestone in my learning journey.

As the day comes to an end, I reflect on my accomplishments with a sense of satisfaction and anticipation. With 53 more days ahead in this remarkable journey, I'm eagerly looking forward to the challenges and achievements that lie ahead.
