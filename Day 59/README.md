# Day 59: Enhancing the Blog Capstone Project

## Reflection

In today's session, I dedicated my efforts to enhancing the blog capstone project. My focus was on adding key features like an interactive navigation bar, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and applying styling through Bootstrap templates.

Additionally, I took the opportunity to delve into the world of Django as part of my Information Management class. I followed a beginner tutorial, which provided a solid foundation for understanding Django's basics. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHux0gMZ3Eg&t=922s).

Admittedly, my progress has been somewhat sluggish due to the demands of school, but I remain committed to advancing the project whenever I can carve out some free time, perhaps on weekends or during breaks.

With determination, I press on, knowing that there are 41 Days left to accomplish my 100 Days of Code journey!
