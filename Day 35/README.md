# Day 35: Exploring API Keys, Authentication, Environmental Variables, and Sending SMS

## Reflection

  Today, I focused on Day 35 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. It was a fruitful day where I learned about various essential concepts, such as API Keys, API Authentication, and Environment Variables. Understanding their role in securely storing API Keys was particularly valuable. Additionally, I grasped how to utilize the Twilio API to send SMS messages in Python. These newfound skills motivated me to embark on creating the final project, "Rain Alert" - a Python script that sends me messages, reminding me to bring an umbrella when rain is forecasted. To achieve this, I integrated the Twilio API for message sending and leveraged PythonAnywhere for automation.

  Despite encountering some challenges during the project like not knowing that it takes 2 hours for key activation, I persevered and successfully found a way to complete it. Subsequently, I decided to conclude my day's work on this challenge, opting to focus on my PhilNits review. With 65 days remaining in the 100 Days of Python journey, I am eager and excited about the forthcoming learning opportunities and growth. Onwards to more coding adventures!
