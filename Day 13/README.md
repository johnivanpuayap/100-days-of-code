# Day 13: Learning to Debug using a Debugger
## Reflection
 Today was an exciting day as I delved into the topic of debugging in the 100 Days of Python Course. I had a strong desire to learn how to effectively use a debugger, and this section fulfilled that goal. Although there was no final project, I had the opportunity to work on three exercises specifically designed to enhance my debugging skills, resulting in a lighter workload for the day..

 In addition to my Python course, I also made progress on the Responsive Web Design Certificate. I successfully completed the "Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting" section, which provided valuable insights into border-radius, box-shadow, transform, and filter properties.
 
 Since it was a Saturday, I decided to dedicate some time to review my knowledge of Permutation and Combination. Strengthening my understanding of this mathematical concept was a productive way to conclude the day.
 
 Conclusion
 With 97 days remaining in the 100 Days of Python Course, I am motivated to continue my learning journey. Today's focus on debugging using a debugger was enlightening, and I look forward to applying this newfound knowledge in future projects. Additionally, my progress in the Responsive Web Design Certificate and review of Permutation and Combination further solidified my understanding in these areas. I am excited to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the most of the remaining days.
