# Day 13: Learning to Debug using a Debugger
## Reflection
 Today was an exciting day as I delved into the topic of debugging in the 100 Days of Python Course. I had a strong desire to learn how to effectively use a debugger, and this section fulfilled that goal. Although there was no final project, I had the opportunity to work on three exercises specifically designed to enhance my debugging skills, resulting in a lighter workload for the day. Here are some debugging tips I learned
 1. Describe the Problem
 2. Reproduce the Bug
 3. Play as a Computer
 4. Fix the Errors
 5. Print is your Friend
 6. Use a Debugger
 7. Take a Break
 8. Ask Someone Else
 9. Run Your Code Often

 In addition to my Python course, I also made progress on the Responsive Web Design Certificate. I successfully completed the "Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting" section, which provided valuable insights into border-radius, box-shadow, transform, and filter properties.
 
 Since it was a Saturday, I decided to dedicate some time to review my knowledge of Permutation and Combination. Strengthening my understanding of this mathematical concept was a productive way to conclude the day.
 
 Conclusion
 Today's focus on debugging using a debugger was enlightening, and I look forward to applying this from now on when working on personal and school projects. Additionally, I made progress in the Responsive Web Design Certificate and was also able review of Permutation and Combination further solidified my understanding as a review for my Philnits Exam. With 97 days remaining in the 100 Days of Python Course, I am excited to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the most of the remaining days
