# Day 13: Learning to Debug using a Debugger
## Reflection
 Today, as usual I started on the 100 Days of Python Course. Day 13 section focuses on Debugging. One of things I really want to start learning is using a debugger. So I'm excited about this part. Actually, There is no final project today but there are 3 main exercises that are geared towards learning to debug so today's workload was light.

 After that I made some progress, on the Responsive Web Design Certificate and finished on Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting section.
 
 Since today was a Saturday, I needed to review so to end the day, I reviewed my knowledge on Permutation and Combination.
 
 Conclusion
 
 97 Days to go!
## Progress
 - Finished Day 13 of 100 Days of Python
