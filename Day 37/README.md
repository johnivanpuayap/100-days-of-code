# Day 37: HTTP POST Requests and Building a Habit Tracking App

## Reflection
  Today, I embarked on Day 37 of my 100 Days of Python challenge. During this journey, I delved into the world of HTTP requests, exploring various types like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The focus of the day was on understanding and implementing POST requests. Additionally, I gained knowledge about HTTP headers and their significance in web communications. The day's main project involved building a habit tracker utilizing the Pixela API. With this API, I can easily post data and track my daily coding hours.

  Continuing my learning journey, I made progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification. I resumed working on the Third Certification Project, creating a Technical Documentation Page. This page serves as a comprehensive reference on a specific topic. I challenged myself to recreate the example website (accessible [here](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/), I had to copy) without relying on the inspect tool, resulting in an almost 1:1 copy of the original.

  As the day drew to a close, I decided to rest since the day had been both productive and exhausting. I take pride in the progress I made today and am determined to maintain this momentum throughout the remaining 63 days of my learning and coding journey!
