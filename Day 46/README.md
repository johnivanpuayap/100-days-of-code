# Day 46: Creating Playlists with the Spotify API

## Reflection

Today marked the continuation of my journey through the 100 Days of Python challenge. I delved into Day 46, which revolved around a captivating project: the creation of a Musical Time Machine. This innovative concept allows users to input a specific date, prompting the program to retrieve songs from Billboard's TOP 100 list of that week. These extracted songs are then used to create a Spotify playlist.

While the project proved exciting, it was not without its hurdles. One notable challenge was navigating the intricacies of the Spotipy module, which presented difficulties due to its somewhat limited documentation. However, I persevered and successfully brought the project to fruition.

Continuing my productive day, I dedicated time to completing the Exception Module within the Python Intermediate course. This module provided a valuable review of previously learned concepts, and I found the material to be refreshingly straightforward.

As I concluded Day 46, I couldn't help but reflect on the rewarding experiences and knowledge gained. With 54 days remaining in this challenge, I eagerly anticipate the further growth and learning that each day will bring.
