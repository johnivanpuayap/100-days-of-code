# Day 33: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

## Reflection
    Today, I started by completing an activity I missed yesterday on Day 32 of 100 Days of Python, which involved learning how to run a Python code/script in the cloud using PythonAnywhere.
    
    After that, I delved into the world of APIs, understanding how they function and how to utilize them. This included grasping concepts like API endpoints, making API requests, using the request module in Python, interpreting response codes, and working with API parameters. As part of the learning process, I successfully completed exercises such as creating a Kanye Quotes App that fetches quotes from the Kanye Rest API and using the sunset and sunrise times API. Additionally, I completed the main project of the day, the International Space Station Overhead Notifier Project.

    Next, I proceeded with my progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification. I started the Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano section, where I deepened my knowledge of media queries and pseudo selectors.

    What an enriching day! I had yearned to learn how to use APIs for a long time, but I was initially apprehensive and thought it would be challenging. Now, I'm excited to tackle more projects. With 67 Days remaining, I am truly loving this journey!
