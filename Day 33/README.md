# Day 33: Application Programming Interface (APIs)

## Reflection
    Today, I first worked on something I missed yesterday in Day 32 of 100 Days of Python, which was learning how to run a Python code/script in the cloud using PythonAnywhere. 
    
    After, I learned about APIs, how do they work and how to use them, API requests and how to make a request, the request module in python, response codes and what do they mean. I was able to complete an exercise to build a Kanye Quotes App using the Kanye Rest API and complete the main project of the day which is to create an International Space Station Overhead Notifier Project.

    Next, I head over to make progress on Responsive Web Design Certification. I started the Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano section where I learned more about media queries and pseudo selectors.
