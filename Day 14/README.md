# Day 14: Higher-Lower Game and Setting up a Local Environment
## Reflection
 Today, I began my learning on Day 14 of the 100 Days of Python. Day 14 focuses on one main project called Higher-Lower Game. 
 
 After finishing Day 14, I decided to finish Day 15 as well since it was about setting up a local environment by installing Python and PyCharm on my Laptop, which I already did on Day 1 and a Coffee Machine program.

 Looking ahead, I have some exciting news to share. I will be going on vacation from Monday to Friday next week. Initially, I had planned to continue the challenge during my vacation, but I realized the importance of taking breaks for rejuvenation. Therefore, I have decided to pause the challenge for the duration of my vacation. 
 
 Conclusion
 Today, I was able to complete two days' worth of content since Day 14 focused on a single project, and I had already covered most of the material from Day 15. With the completion of these tasks, I feel a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the upcoming break. This vacation presents an opportunity for me to recharge and return with renewed energy to tackle the more challenging aspects of the remaining days. It's encouraging to know that I have only 96 more days to go in this journey.
