# Day 19: Snake Game Project

## Reflection
  I was still busy today with other things but I really wanted to finish the Snake Game already so I decided to try to finish it as much as possible. 

  Whenever I start a new project, I make sure to breakdown the problem to small parts first, this way it will be easier for me to implement, I will not be overwhelmed about what I need to do and I can see my progress as a reward to my brain. After thinking about, here's how I want to do the project
  1. Create the snake
  2. Make the snake move
  3. Enable user to control the snake
  4. Generate food randomly on the game screen
  5. Detect collision with the food
  6. Create a scoreboard
  7. Detect collision with the wall
  8. Detect collision with the body
  9. Allow users to choose difficulty and adjust the snake's speed accordingly

  While I had initially envisioned including additional features such as a main menu, high score tracking, different stages, and customizable snake colors, further research revealed that some of these features cannot be implemented using the turtle module. Therefore, it is best to focus on completing the main requirements of the project and only include the difficulty level based on the snake's speed.

  However, I am excited about the possibilities and future versions of the Snake Game. In the future, I plan to create a full-blown software version of the game using the pygame module, which will allow for a more extensive and customizable experience.

  Conclusion:
  
  Today, I made significant progress on the Snake Game project following a systematic approach and breaking down the tasks. Despite the limitations of the turtle module, I remain motivated to explore more advanced game development using the pygame module. I am confident that this project will serve as a foundation for future game development endeavors.

  The journey of the 100 Days of Python challenge has been an incredible learning experience so far, and I am determined to make the most of the remaining 81 days to expand my programming skills and accomplish more exciting projects.
