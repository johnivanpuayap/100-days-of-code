# Day 19: Snake Game Project Part 1

## Reflection
  Today, despite being busy with other commitments, I was determined to make progress on the Snake Game project. I wanted to finish it as much as possible and decided to focus on completing the essential features.

  To tackle the project effectively, I followed my usual approach of breaking down the problem into smaller parts. This strategy helps me to implement the project more easily, avoid feeling overwhelmed, and provides a sense of accomplishment as I make progress. Here is the breakdown of the tasks I planned for the project:
  
  1. Create the snake
  2. Make the snake move
  3. Enable user to control the snake
  4. Generate food randomly on the game screen
  5. Detect collision with the food
  6. Create a scoreboard
  7. Detect collision with the wall
  8. Detect collision with the body
  9. Allow users to choose difficulty and adjust the snake's speed accordingly

  While I had initially envisioned including additional features such as a main menu, high score tracking, different stages, and customizable snake colors, further research revealed that some of these features cannot be implemented using the turtle module. Therefore, it is best to focus on completing the main requirements of the project and only include the difficulty level based on the snake's speed.

  However, I am excited about the possibilities and future versions of the Snake Game. In the future, I plan to create a full-blown software version of the game using the pygame module, which will allow for a more extensive and customizable experience.

  Conclusion:
  
  Today, I made significant progress on the Snake Game project following a systematic approach and breaking down the tasks. Despite the limitations of the turtle module, I remain motivated to explore more advanced game development using the pygame module. I am confident that this project will serve as a foundation for future game development endeavors.

  The journey of the 100 Days of Python challenge has been an incredible learning experience so far, and I am determined to make the most of the remaining 81 days to expand my programming skills and accomplish more exciting projects.
