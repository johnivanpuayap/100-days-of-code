# Day 50: Creating an Auto Tinder Swiping Bot

## Reflection

After a two day break, I'm back! Day 50 is about creating an auto tinder bot using Selenium.

That marks the end of my day! 50 days done already and 50 more to go!

## Progress

- Completed Day 50 of 100 Days of Python
- Finished the [Job Application Automation](https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/JobApplicationAutomation)
