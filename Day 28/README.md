# Day 28: Building a Pomodoro GUI Application with Tkinter

## Reflection  
  Today marked Day 28 of my 100 Days of Python journey, and it was an eventful day filled with learning and accomplishments. I dedicated my time to exploring Tkinter, a powerful library for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. Here's a summary of what I learned and achieved:

  - **Tkinter and Canvas Widget**: I delved into Tkinter, where I gained a deeper understanding of its Canvas Widget. I discovered how to add images, which allowed me to incorporate a tomato image into my Pomodoro GUI Application.

  - **Dynamic Typing in Python**: As I worked on the Pomodoro GUI App, I also encountered the concept of dynamic typing in Python. It's a fascinating feature that allows variables to change data types during runtime, enhancing the language's flexibility.

  - **Building the Pomodoro GUI App**: The highlight of the day was creating a functional Pomodoro GUI App. The process involved several key steps:
    1. **User Interface**: I designed the User Interface with components like labels, buttons, and spinboxes, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience
    2. **Countdown Mechanism**: Implementing a countdown mechanism was crucial for accurate time tracking during Pomodoro sessions.
    3. **Pomodoro System Logic**: I incorporated the Pomodoro System logic, enabling the app to manage work sessions and breaks efficiently.
    4. **Checkmarks for Completed Work**: After each successful work session, I added checkmarks as a visual indicator to see how many work sessions was done.
    5. **Reset Button**: To provide users with flexibility, I included a reset button to restart the timer or clear completed work sessions.

  With the Pomodoro GUI App successfully built and functional, I'm thrilled to see my progress in Python and Tkinter.

  Although I had to end the day early to review for the upcoming Philnits exam, I am content with what I accomplished. Completing Day 28 of 100 Days of Python was my main goal, and I'm proud to have achieved it. As I reflect on my journey, I have 72 more days to make the most out of this challenge and continue my growth as a Python programmer.
