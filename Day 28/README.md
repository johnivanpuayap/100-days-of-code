# Day 28: Pomodoro GUI Application

## Reflection  
  Today, I completed Day 28 of 100 Days of Python where I learned more about Tkinter like the Canvas Widget and how to add Images, I also learned about dynamic typing in python and lastly I built a Pomodoro GUI App using the Tkinter library. Here is how I built the Pomodoro GUI App.

  I ended the day early to review for the Philnits the exam, since I haven't reviewed for a while.

  Conclusion
