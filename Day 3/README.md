# Day 3: Doing Extra Work

## Reflection
 Today, my primary focus was on progressing in my learning journey, aligning it with the 100 Days of Python course. I successfully completed both Day 2 and Day 3 of the course, and alongside that, I continued my studies in the Responsive Web Design Certification.

 During Day 2 of the 100 Days of Python, I covered important topics such as type casting, mathematical operators like double asterisks and floor division, as well as the usage of f-strings. The main exercise of the day, the tip calculator, allowed users to input their bill, tip percentage, and the number of people, and the program calculated and displayed the bill per person, including the tip.

 Moving forward to Day 3, I delved into control flow and logical operators in Python. Although the syntax of if/else statements differed slightly from what I was accustomed to, the provided real-life scenarios helped me understand them easily. Despite my existing knowledge in these areas, I appreciated the practical approach to reinforce my understanding. The main exercise, "Treasure Island," was an engaging command-line game where users made choices and navigated through the gameplay.

 Simultaneously, in my Responsive Web Design Certification, I completed the Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers section. This module introduced me to various methods of defining color values using RGB, hexadecimal, and HSL. Additionally, I learned how to implement linear gradients using the different methods of defining color values.

 Overall, today's focus on both Python and web design studies allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills. I'm excited to continue my progress and make further enhancements in the remaining 97 days of this exciting learning journey!
