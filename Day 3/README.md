# Day 3: Doing Extra Work

## Reflection
 Today was a productive day where I dedicated my efforts to aligning my progress with the Day number on the 100 Days of Python course. I successfully completed both Day 2 and Day 3 of the course, making steady progress in my Introduction to Python course. Additionally, I continued my studies in the Responsive Web Design Certification, expanding my knowledge and skills in web development.

 During Day 2 of the 100 Days of Python, I learned important topics such as type casting, mathematical operators (including double asterisks and floor division), and the usage of f-strings. To reinforce my understanding, I worked on the main exercise of the day, the tip calculator. This program allowed users to input their bill, tip percentage, and the number of people, and it calculated and displayed the bill per person, including the tip.

 Moving forward to Day 3, I delved into control flow and logical operators in Python. Although the syntax of if/else statements differed slightly from what I was accustomed to, the real-life scenarios provided in the course helped me grasp them easily. Despite having prior knowledge in these areas, I appreciated the practical approach taken, which reinforced my understanding. The main exercise, "Treasure Island" was an engaging command-line game where users made choices and navigated through the gameplay.

 In my Responsive Web Design Certification, I completed the "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers" section. This module introduced me to various methods of defining color values using RGB, hexadecimal, and HSL. Additionally, I learned how to implement linear gradients using these different color value methods.

 To conclude the day, I made progress in the "Getting Started" section of the Introduction to Python Course on Sololearn.

 Overall, today was a long but highly productive day. I remained focused for 4 hours, allowing me to complete Day 2 and Day 3 of the 100 Days of Python course, make progress in the Introduction to Python course on Sololearn, and continue advancing in the Responsive Web Design Certification. I'm optimistic that this momentum will carry forward for the next 97 days.
