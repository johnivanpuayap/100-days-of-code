# Day 34: Creating a Quiz App as an API Practice
## Reflection
  Today marks Day 34 of my 100 Days of Python journey, and it was an exciting one as I delved into the world of API development by creating a Quiz App. This intermediate-level concept challenged my skills and provided an excellent opportunity to practice working with APIs.

  The task was to use the Day 17 final project to build an improved Quiz App that fetches trivia questions from an online API named Open Trivia Databases and presents them to the user and also used Tkinter, to create the Graphical User Interface.

  Continuing from yesterday, I successfully finished the "Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano" section. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a responsive piano that adapts to various screen sizes. The piano could be played with both mouse clicks and keyboard presses, providing an interactive and enjoyable experience for users.

  As I progress in my 100 Days of Python challenge and Responsive Web Design Certification, I'm excited to continue exploring new concepts, taking on more projects, and honing my skills in both Tkinter-based GUI development and responsive web design. The journey has been enlightening so far, and I'm eager to see what the next 66 days have in store for me. Onwards to more learning and growth!
