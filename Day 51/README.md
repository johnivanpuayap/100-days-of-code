# Day 51: Developing an Internet Speed Complaint Bot for Twitter

## Reflection

Today marked Day 51 of my journey, during which I embarked on an intriguing project - crafting a Twitter bot designed to voice complaints about slow internet speeds directly to our ISP's official handle. This project resonates with me, given the frequent frustration I experience due to sluggish internet, a recurring theme in my recent updates.

In parallel, I dedicated time to advancing my skills by delving into the "Learn CSS Grid" module. While I didn't reach the finish line, I'm committed to wrapping it up by tomorrow.

As the day concludes, I find myself looking ahead with anticipation to the next 49 days of this enriching learning expedition.
