# Day 57: Advancing Flask Skills and Kicking Off the Blog Website

## Reflection

After a hiatus for school preparations and my trip to Cebu, I've returned to my 100 Days of Code challenge. Today marks Day 57, and it's been a productive one.

I delved into the world of URL Building and Templating with Jinja, equipping myself with essential skills to create more sophisticated Flask applications. Along the way, I tackled exercises like crafting dynamic footers using Jinja and integrating Jinja templating with APIs. I also got acquainted with n:point, a data service that enabled me to gather content for my blogs.

Notably, Day 57 is the first part of the 5th Capstone Project - building a blog website. For this part, I set up a very simple blog that shows some blog posts using the Flask framework and Jira for templating.

Although I had to wrap up the day early due to other commitments, I'm already gratified with my progress. With 43 more days ahead, the journey promises more exciting challenges and learning opportunities.
