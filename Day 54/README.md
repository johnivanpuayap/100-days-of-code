# Day 54: Embarking on the Python Web Development Journey

## Reflection

Today marked Day 54 of my 100 Days of Python challenge, and it was a day of broad exploration. I delved into various subjects, including the command line, python decorators, backend web development, and Flask â€“ a leading Python framework for creating websites.

I gained hands-on experience in setting up a web server using Flask, expanding my knowledge of web development. The day culminated in crafting my own Python decorator, showcasing my progress in applying advanced Python concepts.

While attempting to explore Python Data Structures on Sololearn, I discovered the course was deprecated. This prompted me to seek alternative free Python courses that can further enhance my skills.

With Day 54 completed, I'm excited about delving deeper into web development with Flask in the coming days. Anticipation for the journey ahead fuels my determination as I continue with 46 days remaining in this challenge.
