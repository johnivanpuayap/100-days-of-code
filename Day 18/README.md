# Day 18: Just Showing Up
## Reflection

  Today, I was so busy that I started at 8pm but I still want to be able to do something for today, so I tried to do as much as possible before I go to sleep. My main goal today was actually completing the Snake Game which is 2 parts/days, I decided to postpone it and just get progress on Python Intermediate Course and the Responsive Web Design Certification and also create the main repository for the Snake Game Progress.
  
  I started by making progress on the Functional Programming Module. I learned about pure and impure functions, Lambdas, the built in higher order functions: map & filter, Generators and Decorators. While, I already finished those topics, I definitely want to revisit those topics tomorrow or some other time and dive deeper on those topics.

  After that, I made some progress on the Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label Section of the Responsive Web Design Certification. The focus on this section was all about text. I was able to learn how to style text, adjust line height, and position text using CSS and also was able to learn how to link an external CSS file.

  I ended the day by creating a repository for the Snake Game Project on Day 20 and Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python and also made a little bit of progress on Day 20
  
  Conclusion
  Today was a slow day since I was really busy but what really matters is showing up, even if you do little just show up. Hopefully, I am able to do more tomorrow and make better progress. 82 more days to go
