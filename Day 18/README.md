# Day 18:
## Reflection

  Today, I was so busy that I started at 8pm but I still want to be able to do something for today, so I tried to do as much as possible before I go to sleep.

  I started by making progress on the Functional Programming Module. I learned about pure and impure functions, Lambdas (which I am still not comfortable with so I need to review on it further), Map & Filters, Generators and Decorators

  After that

  I ended the day by creating a repository for the Snake Game Project on Day 20 and Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python and also made a little bit of progress on Day 20
  
  Conclusion
  Today was a slow day since I was really busy but what really matters is showing up, even if you do little just show up. Hopefully, I am able to do more tomorrow and make better progress. 82 more days to go
