# Day 18: Showing Up
## Reflection

  Today was a particularly busy day for me, and I only managed to start working at 8 PM. Despite the limited time available, I was determined to accomplish something meaningful before calling it a day. Although my original plan was to complete the Snake Game, a multi-day project, I decided to postpone it for now and focus on other tasks. Consequently, I made progress on the Python Intermediate Course, delved into the Responsive Web Design Certification, and established the main repository for tracking the Snake Game project's progress.

  I began my day by advancing through the Functional Programming module. This module covered essential concepts such as pure and impure functions, Lambdas, built-in higher-order functions like map and filter, Generators, and Decorators. While I have covered these topics before, I intend to revisit them in more depth in the future to enhance my understanding.

  Afterward, I dedicated some time to the "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label" section of the Responsive Web Design Certification. This section focused on text styling, including techniques for adjusting line height and positioning text using CSS. I learned things like the attribute letter-spacing and that you can create an html selector on css.

  To conclude the day, I created a repository on GitHub for the Snake Game Project, specifically for Day 20 and Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python challenge and made a little bit of progress on Day 20 of the 100 Days of Python.
  
  Conclusion
  Despite facing time constraints, I firmly believe that the act of showing up, even with limited capacity, is of utmost importance. Showing up, regardless of the circumstances or constraints, is essential because it demonstrates commitment, builds discipline, and cultivates a growth mindset.

  As I look forward to the coming days, I remain hopeful for a more productive tomorrow. Despite the challenges encountered today, I understand that this journey is comprised of numerous ups and downs. The commitment to show up consistently, with determination and resilience, will propel me closer to my goals. With 82 more days ahead, I am eager to embrace the opportunities they hold and make significant strides toward my aspirations.
