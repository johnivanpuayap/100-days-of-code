# Day 11: First Capstone Project
## Reflection
 Today, I am doing the First Capstone Project named BlackJack

 Here is how did it:
 1. Define the functions for the calculator operations.
 2. Define a dictionary named "operations" with operation symbols as keys and corresponding function names as values.
 3. Write code to prompt the user for the first number, second number, and the desired operation.
 4. Create a variable to store the function associated with the chosen operation by retrieving it from the "operations" dictionary based on the user input.
 5. Perform the calculation using the selected function and display the result.
 6. Modify the code to repeatedly ask for the second number until the user chooses to exit. Make sure to update the first number in each iteration.
 8. Include an option to restart the calculation by incorporating the code within the function and calling it again when the user wants to start over.
 9. Add an else condition to exit the calculator when any other character is pressed. Ensure to set the variable controlling the while loop in the initial instance of the calculator function to false, allowing us to exit both the current calculator and the outer while loop.
 10. Add modulo operator for fun


 Conclusion:

## Progress
