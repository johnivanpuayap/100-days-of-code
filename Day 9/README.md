# Day 9: Completing the Introduction to Python Course on Sololearn
## Reflection
 Today, I made progress by completing Day 9 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. This section focused on dictionaries and nesting lists and dictionaries. I found dictionaries in Python to be similar to hash tables or hash maps in other programming languages. I didn't encounter any difficulties so far and smoothly completed the exercises.

 The main project for today involved building a silent auction program. Once you understand how dictionaries work, it's actually quite simple. Here's an overview of how I approached it:

 1. I started by creating an empty dictionary and then implemented a while loop that continues until there are no more bidders.
 2. Within the loop, I asked the user for their name and bid, and then added them to the dictionary as key-value pairs.
 3. Once there are no more bidders (when the user indicates so), I used the max function to find the highest bidder. I researched and learned that a lambda function is needed to use max with dictionaries. Before incorporating the code, I ensured I understood how it worked.
 4. Finally, I printed the highest bidder's details.

 That's all there is to it. While it's also possible to find the highest bidder using a for loop, I discovered that max is more efficient since it's implemented in C. I acknowledge that for small input sizes, this efficiency gain may not be significant. However, I believe it's beneficial to be aware of more efficient approaches, similar to using a StringBuilder to concatenate strings in Java instead of the + operator. It's useful to practice and become familiar with such methods, especially since once you become a software engineer, you will be working on larger input sizess.

 After completing the auction project, I continued with the Introduction to Python Course. This course covered topics that weren't included in the 100 Days of Python challenge, such as list slices and DocStrings which are actually quite helpful. Since the introduction course only covered lists and functions, I plan to proceed to the Python Intermediate Course. However, I anticipate that it may be slightly more challenging and require more time.

 Conclusion

 Today marks the completion of my first project or task in this coding challenge. I recognize that it's only an introductory course, and I still have a long way to go to become proficient in Python, which is my ultimate goal. Nevertheless, it's essential to celebrate small wins along the way. I have 91 more days to go, and I'm excited about the progress I've made so far!
