# Day 9: Completing the Introduction to Python Course on Sololearn
## Reflection
 Today, I started off by completing Day 9 of 100 Days of Python. This section covers dictionary and nesting lists and dictionary. First thing I noticed is, dictionary in python is just a hash table or a hash map in other programming languages. So far I still don't have any troubles and was still cruisin at the exercises.

 The main project is building a silent auction program. Here's how I did it
 1. 

 What I did next was finish the Introduction to Python Course first. The introduction only covered until lists and functions, therefore I will continue to the Python Intermediate Course but I will definitely be slower and gonna need more time as it probably is going to be a little bit harder than this one.

 Conclusion
 Today marks the first project or task that I wanted to do in this coding challenge. I know that it's only an introduction course and I still have a long way to go to be good python which is the main goal but hey, we need to celebrate small wins. 91 more days to go!
