# Day 36: Embarking on my "What to Watch?" Personal Project

## Reflection
  Today was an inspiring day filled with newfound excitement as I delved into the world of personal projects. While casually browsing through YouTube, I stumbled upon a video suggesting intriguing personal project ideas. One particular concept caught my attention - creating a desktop app that recommends movies or TV shows based on individual preferences. Eager to challenge myself and elevate my Python skills, I promptly decided to embark on this journey.

  After thorough contemplation, I charted a course to build a user-friendly desktop app using Python and the Tkinter library for its Graphical User Interface. To gather movie data seamlessly, I opted to integrate The Movie Database (TMDb) API into my project. For now, I chose to focus on the initial version (v1.0) of the app to avoid feeling overwhelmed by its potential future extensions, such as user accounts and a TV show tracker. A modest start would ensure steady progress and keep me engaged.

  With the research phase initiated and the project repository set up, I meticulously planned my next steps to strike a balance between working on this endeavor and staying committed to my ongoing 100 Days of Python challenge.

  Alongside my personal project endeavors, I also managed to complete Day 36 of my 100 Days of Python challenge. For this day's challenge, I created a simple stock monitoring project that sends the user a daily summary of a stock with price changes and relevant news. I skillfully utilized the Alpha Vantage API to fetch stock prices for specific dates of interest and complemented this with relevant company news extracted using the News API.

  Today's achievements have only fueled my passion for both personal projects and the 100 Days of Code challenge. I am excitedly looking forward to the next 64 days of this enriching journey!
