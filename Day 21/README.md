# Day 21: Pong Game

## Reflection
  For today, I started as usual with the 100 Days of Python, Day 22 is all about coding the Arcade Game Pong in Python using the turtle module. First of all, I started by breaking down the what I needed to do, here is how I intend to solve it:

  1. Create the screen
  2. Create the paddles and make it move
  3. Create the ball and make it move
  4. Detect collision with walls and make it bounce 
  5. Detect collision with paddle and make it bounce
  6. Detect when the ball hit through the goal
  7. Create the scoreboard

  Conclusion
