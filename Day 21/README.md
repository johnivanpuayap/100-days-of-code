# Day 21: Pong Game

## Reflection
  For today, I followed Day 22 of the 100 Days of Python course, which involved coding the Arcade Game Pong in Python using the turtle module. I began by breaking down the steps required to complete the game:

  1. Create the game screen.
  2. Create the paddles and enable their movement.
  3. Create the ball and enable its movement.
  4. Implement collision detection with the walls to make the ball bounce
  5. Implement collision detection with the paddles to make the ball bounce.
  6. Track when the ball passes through the paddles
  7. Create the scoreboard.

  Once I finished coding the Pong Game, I made progress on the "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" section of the Responsive Web Design Certification. This section focuses on making webpages accessible for all users, including those with disabilities.

  Conclusion

  I'm excited about the progress I made today. The Pong Game was a fun project to work on, and it helped me improve my Python skills. Additionally, delving into web accessibility is an important step in becoming a well-rounded developer. With 79 days remaining, I'm motivated to continue learning and exploring new concepts. I look forward to the upcoming days of the challenge and the knowledge and experience they will bring.
