# Day 20: Completing the Snake Game Project

## Reflection
  Today marks a significant milestone as I complete Day 20 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. It's been an exciting journey so far, filled with learning and progress. As part of today's challenge, I focused on finishing the Snake Game Project.

  During the project, I not only implemented the core requirements but also added some extra features to enhance the game experience. Here are the changes I made:

  1. Restricting the snake's movement to prevent it from going backward, making the game more challenging and realistic.
  2. Introducing two additional types of food based on a random percentage, adding variety and surprises to the game.
  3. Implementing a difficulty level by increasing the snake's speed every 10 points, making the game progressively more difficult as the player progresses.
  4. Incorporating a restart feature, allowing players to reset the game and try again for a better score.

  After implementing the additional features to the Snake Game, I took some time to refactor the codebase. Refactoring allowed me to improve the structure, organization, and readability of the code, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.

  With the Snake Game project completed for now, I shifted gears and continued my learning journey. I spent the remaining time of the day completing the "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label" section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. This section provided valuable insights into typography principles and how to apply them effectively in web design.

  Conclusion

  Completing the Snake Game Project on Day 20 is a significant accomplishment. It demonstrates how far I've come in the 100 Days of Python challenge and highlights my growing skills as a Python developer. I'm proud of the progress I've made and the knowledge I've gained.

  As I celebrate this 20th-day milestone, I look forward to the next 80 days of the challenge. There's still a lot more to learn, explore, and create. I'm excited about the upcoming projects and the opportunities they will bring to deepen my understanding of Python and expand my programming capabilities.

  Here's to the next 80 days of the 100 Days of Python challenge, filled with continuous growth, new achievements, and exciting coding adventures!
