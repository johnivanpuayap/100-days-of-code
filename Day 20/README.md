# Day 20:

## Reflection
  Today, I started by finishing the Snake Game Project by completing Day 21 of the 100 Days of Python. I learned about topics like inheritance. Multiple inheritance is actually allowed in Python, which is not the case on Java and C++.


  Here is what I changed to the project requirements:
  1. The snake can't go backwards/ the opposite side like for example if the snake is going to the right, then it can't go to the left but can go up or down.


  Conclusion
