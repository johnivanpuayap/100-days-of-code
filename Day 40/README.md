# Day 40: Completing the Cheap Flight Finder Capstone Project

## Reflection
  Today, there was actually no internet so I just finished Day 40, part 2 of the Capstone Project, where I upgraded the Cheap Flight Finder to a fully-fledged product by adding a command line interface that lets user sign up, upgrading the sending feature to send the cheap flight info to all of the users who signed up, and also adding exception handling to handle exceptions and errors.

  After finishing the project, Since there was still no internet, I decided to end my day. We are finally moving on to the expert after, I can't wait to continue building more projects for the next 60 days.
