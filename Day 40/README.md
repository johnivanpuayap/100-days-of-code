# Day 40: Completing the Cheap Flight Finder Capstone Project

## Reflection
  Today, I encountered an unexpected challenge when the internet went down. Nevertheless, I made the most of the situation and managed to accomplish Day 40, part 2 of the Capstone Project. In this phase, I elevated the Cheap Flight Finder from a basic tool to a fully-fledged product. I achieved this by implementing a user-friendly command-line interface that facilitates user sign-ups. Additionally, I upgraded the system's sending feature to deliver cheap flight information to all registered users. To ensure the app's robustness, I incorporated comprehensive exception handling to manage any potential errors or exceptions that may arise.

  Despite the internet outage, I am proud to have completed the project. Consequently, I decided to wrap up my work for the day. Looking forward to the future, I noticed that the next 4 lessons are about Web Foundation, so I might be faster than normal on those lessons. Nevertheless, I only have 60 days to go on this learning journey.
