# Day 38: Creating a Workout Tracking App using Google Sheets and the Nutritionix API

## Reflection
  On Day 38, I took on the challenge of creating a Workout Tracking App using Python, Google Sheets, and the Nutritionix API as part of my 100 Days of Python journey. Although the project was relatively straightforward, I faced some challenges due to slow internet, which made it quite frustrating to read the documentation and implement the features. Additionally, I encountered a few bugs, mostly caused by overlooking details in the documentation. Despite these obstacles, I persevered and successfully completed the app.

  In addition to the Workout Tracking App, I also solved two easy LeetCode questions from the LeetCode 75 Level 1 category using Python. The questions were "Running Sum of 1d Array" and "Find Pivot Index." While I found the problems relatively easy since I had encountered similar ones before, I made sure to optimize my code to enhance my problem-solving skills.

  Lastly, I made progress on the Movie Match Project, focusing on creating the User Interface using the Tkinter module in Python.

  Overall, I am pleased with the substantial progress I made today, and I'm excited to continue creating more projects during the remaining 62 days of this challenge. I look forward to the upcoming days filled with learning, coding, and further accomplishments on this exciting journey.
