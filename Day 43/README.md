# Day 43: Introduction to CSS

## Reflection

Today, I started with 100 Days of Python, where I reviewed my knowledge of CSS by adding CSS on the Bacon Fansite Exercise, I also did some debugging exercises and lastly, added CSS on my Personal Site.

After, I made progress on the Responsive Web Design Certification by starting the Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline section
