# Day 43: Learning CSS and Building Confidence

## Reflection

Today marked an exciting day in my learning journey as I delved into the world of CSS through the 100 Days of Python challenge. I spent time reviewing my CSS knowledge by applying it to the Bacon Fansite Exercise and my Personal Site. I also took on debugging exercises, which further strengthened my grasp on CSS concepts.

The highlight of the day was working on the Responsive Web Design Certification. I made significant progress by diving into the "Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline" section. This module taught me how to reconfigure CSS Variables, enabling me to reuse them efficiently throughout my projects.

While HTML and CSS can feel overwhelming at times, I recognize that this learning process is crucial for me to gain confidence in my skills. Every step I take brings me closer to achieving my goals and becoming a proficient developer. I embrace the challenges and opportunities for improvement that each day presents.

With 57 days remaining in this remarkable journey, I am eager to continue pushing my boundaries and honing my abilities. Embracing this growth mindset, I am excited to see how much I can achieve by the end of this challenge.
