# 100-Days-of-Code

 The "100-Days-of-Code" repository chronicles my personal journey to enhance my coding skills over a period of 100 days, starting from June 5, 2023, and concluding on September 12, 2023. Inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge, this endeavor involves dedicating a minimum of 3 to 4 hours each day to coding activities. For more information about the challenge, you can visit here.

 Within this repository, I have created a dedicated space to document my progress, insights, and acquired knowledge throughout the challenge. It serves as a comprehensive record of my daily logs, reflections, and achievements. Additionally, the repository provides links to the main projects I will be working on during this period.

 Throughout the 100-day challenge, my primary focus areas encompass several key goals. These include improving my HTML and CSS skills, expanding my proficiency in Python programming, developing a personal website with an accompanying blog, completing The Odin Project, preparing for the PhilNits exam, and familiarizing myself with the subjects covered in my upcoming semester's courses. By addressing these objectives, I aim to not only enhance my technical abilities but also broaden my understanding of various web development concepts and prepare for future academic endeavors.

## Goals

 1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp.org.
 2. Create a Personal Website with a blog.
 3. Finish The Odin Project.
 4. Complete the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu.
 5. Begin reviewing for the PhilNits exam.
 6. Start studying for my courses in the first semester of AY 2023-2024.
