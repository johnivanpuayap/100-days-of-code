# 100-days-of-code
The "100-days-of-code" repo is a record of my journey to improve my coding skills for atleast 3 to 4 hours per day over 100 days starting on June 05, 2023 and hopefully ending September 13, 2023. This challenge was inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: 100daysofcode.com or the official repo.

This repo contains my daily logs, reflection, and learnings of all the things I did throughout the challenge. It also contains my goals and achievements gained throughtout the progress. Also contains the links and repo for the main projects I did. On this challenge, I will attempt to improve my html and css skills, create a personal website that will also contain a blog, begin studying for the PhilNits exam, and also get familiarize with all of the topics on my courses next semester.

## Goals
1. Finish the Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp.org
2. Create a Personal Website with a blog
4. Finish the Odin Project
5. Finish 100 Days of Python by Angela Yu 
6. Start Review for PhilNits
7. Start to study for my courses for the first semester of AY 2023 - 2024

## Finished Projects
None so far


## Day 1 - Research and Creating Goals

### Reflection
I believe that for this challenge to succeed, I need to be able to set what my goals are first and make sure to research how will I be able to achieve those goals. After thinking about it for an hour, I decided that I need to improve my html and css skills, after I still kind of struggled especially on css on our project which is a Hospital Management System built on PHP. I want my mastery of it to be atleast on the mastery I have for Java. This is why I'm taking the Responsive Web Design Certification and continuing my progress on The Oding Project. I also wanted to prepare my self for the next semester so I have atleast a good head start for a gruelling semester especially that I'm a heavy procrastinator, so I decided that I want to finish the 100 Days of Python by Angela Yu and also start studying concepts for my Automata Theory and Formal Languages course. Lastly, I also wanted to start studying for the PhilNits Exam when I am not in the mood to code or when I don't have a lot of time. Hopefully I am able to finish this and not be like most of my other personal projects.

### [Progress](https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/100-days-of-code/tree/main/Day%201)
- Finalized my goals on this challenge
- Created the main repo that will serve as a record for my journey.
- Finished the Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

## Day 2 - Setting Up and Starting the Grind

### Reflection
Today, I focused on setting up my development environment by installing PyCharm and Python on my device. While I encountered a minor setback during the installation process due to overlooking the "add to PATH variables" step, I realized that mistakes are valuable learning opportunities, even if they cost me 30 minutes of troubleshooting.

I also began the 100 Days of Python course by Dr. Angela Yu and completed Day 1. Since I already have programming experience, today's exercises were relatively easy for me. Although I tested into the intermediate level of the course, I've decided to start from the beginning to reinforce my knowledge. This approach aligns well with my concurrent pursuit of the Responsive Web Design Certification. I've estimated that I will complete the web design certification before moving on to the intermediate Python material, allowing me to focus fully on the Python course.

Speaking of the Web Design Certification, I successfully finished the Learn Basic CSS section of the certification. Initially, I underestimated the simplicity of this task, but I've come to appreciate the value of practicing even the basic concepts when learning a programming language. Despite considering myself more of a backend developer, I recognize the importance of taking HTML and CSS seriously, as proficiency in these areas enhances collaboration and communication with front-end developers.

Additionally, I explored a PDF resource titled "12 Rules to Learn to Code." This reading provided valuable insights, such as the significance of the 20-minute rule, developing the habit of chunking, and the benefits of analyzing and debugging someone else's code. I highly recommend this resource, particularly to beginners and students. Moreover, I want to emphasize the importance of supplementing practical learning with reading books and watching coding videos. These additional sources have greatly contributed to my growth throughout the semester. I particularly recommend CodeAesthetic's videos, as they have been immensely helpful to me.

### Progress
- Set up PyCharm and Python.
- Completed the "Learn Basic CSS By Building a Cafe Menu" section of the Responsive Web Design Certification.
- Finished Day 1 of the 100 Days of Python course.
