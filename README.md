# 100-days-of-code
The "100-days-of-code" repo is a record of my journey to improve my coding skills for atleast 3 to 4 hours per day over 100 days starting on June 05, 2023 and hopefully ending September 13, 2023. This challenge was inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: 100daysofcode.com or the official repo.

This repo contains my daily logs, reflection, and learnings of all the things I did throughout the challenge. It also contains my goals and achievements gained throughtout the progress. Also contains the links and repo for the main projects I did. On this challenge, I will attempt to improve my html and css skills, create a personal website that will also contain a blog, begin studying for the PhilNits exam, and also get familiarize with all of the topics on my courses next semester.

## Goals
1. Finish the Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp.org
2. Create a Personal Website with a blog
4. Finish the Odin Project
5. Finish 100 Days of Python by Angela Yu 
6. Start Review for PhilNits
7. Start to study for my courses for the first semester of AY 2023 - 2024

## Finished Projects
None so far


## Day 1 - Research and Creating Goals

### Reflection
I believe that for this challenge to succeed, I need to be able to set what my goals are first and make sure to research how will I be able to achieve those goals. After thinking about it for an hour, I decided that I need to improve my html and css skills, after I still kind of struggled especially on css on our project which is a Hospital Management System built on PHP. I want my mastery of it to be atleast on the mastery I have for Java. This is why I'm taking the Responsive Web Design Certification and continuing my progress on The Oding Project. I also wanted to prepare my self for the next semester so I have atleast a good head start for a gruelling semester especially that I'm a heavy procrastinator, so I decided that I want to finish the 100 Days of Python by Angela Yu and also start studying concepts for my Automata Theory and Formal Languages course. Lastly, I also wanted to start studying for the PhilNits Exam when I am not in the mood to code or when I don't have a lot of time. Hopefully I am able to finish this and not be like most of my other personal projects.
