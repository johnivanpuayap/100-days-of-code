# 100-Days-of-Code

The "100-Days-of-Code" repository is a documentation of my journey to enhance my coding skills by dedicating a minimum of 3 to 4 hours each day for 100 days, starting from June 5, 2023, and ending on September 13, 2023. This challenge was inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. You can find more details about the challenge [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com) or in the official repository.

This repository contains my daily logs, reflections, and learnings from the activities I undertake during the challenge. It also includes my goals and achievements throughout the process. Additionally, it provides links to the main projects I work on. During this challenge, I aim to improve my HTML and CSS skills, develop a personal website with a blog, prepare for the PhilNits exam, and familiarize myself with the topics of my upcoming semester courses.

## Goals

1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp.org.
2. Create a Personal Website with a blog.
3. Finish The Odin Project.
4. Complete the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu.
5. Begin reviewing for the PhilNits exam.
6. Start studying for my courses in the first semester of AY 2023-2024.

## Finished Projects

None so far.

## Day 1 - Research and Creating Goals

### Reflection

To ensure the success of this challenge, I believe it is crucial to establish clear goals and conduct thorough research on how to achieve them. After contemplating for an hour, I identified several areas where I want to improve. Specifically, I aim to enhance my HTML and CSS skills as I encountered difficulties in our previous project, a Hospital Management System built with PHP. I want to reach a level of mastery similar to what I have in Java. Hence, I will pursue the Responsive Web Design Certification and continue progressing through The Odin Project.

In addition, I want to prepare myself for the upcoming semester to get a head start. Considering my tendency to procrastinate, I plan to complete the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu and study concepts related to my Automata Theory and Formal Languages course. Lastly, during my leisure time or when I have limited coding hours, I intend to study for the PhilNits Exam. Hopefully, I can successfully accomplish these goals and avoid abandoning them like some of my previous personal projects.
