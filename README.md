# 100-Days-of-Code

The "100-Days-of-Code" repository is a documentation of my journey to enhance my coding skills by dedicating a minimum of 3 to 4 hours each day for 100 days, starting from June 5, 2023, and ending on September 13, 2023. This challenge was inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. You can find more details about the challenge [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com) or in the official repository.

This repository contains my daily logs, reflections, and learnings from the activities I undertake during the challenge. It also includes my goals and achievements throughout the process. Additionally, it provides links to the main projects I work on. During this challenge, I aim to improve my HTML and CSS skills, develop a personal website with a blog, prepare for the PhilNits exam, and familiarize myself with the topics of my upcoming semester courses.

## Goals

1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp.org.
2. Create a Personal Website with a blog.
3. Finish The Odin Project.
4. Complete the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu.
5. Begin reviewing for the PhilNits exam.
6. Start studying for my courses in the first semester of AY 2023-2024.

## Finished Projects

None so far.

## Day 1 - Research and Creating Goals

### Reflection

To ensure the success of this challenge, I believe it is crucial to establish clear goals and conduct thorough research on how to achieve them. After contemplating for an hour, I identified several areas where I want to improve. Specifically, I aim to enhance my HTML and CSS skills as I encountered difficulties in our previous project, a Hospital Management System built with PHP. I want to reach a level of mastery similar to what I have in Java. Hence, I will pursue the Responsive Web Design Certification and continue progressing through The Odin Project.

In addition, I want to prepare myself for the upcoming semester to get a head start. Considering my tendency to procrastinate, I plan to complete the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu and study concepts related to my Automata Theory and Formal Languages course. Lastly, during my leisure time or when I have limited coding hours, I intend to study for the PhilNits Exam. Hopefully, I can successfully accomplish these goals and avoid abandoning them like some of my previous personal projects.

- Finished the Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App part of the Responsive Web Design Certification by FCC

## Day 2 - Setting Up and Starting the Grind

### Reflection
Today, I focused on setting up my development environment by installing PyCharm and Python on my device. While I encountered a minor setback during the installation process due to overlooking the "add to PATH variables" step, I realized that mistakes are valuable learning opportunities, even if they cost me 30 minutes of troubleshooting.

I also began the 100 Days of Python course by Dr. Angela Yu and completed Day 1. Since I already have programming experience, today's exercises were relatively easy for me. Although I tested into the intermediate level of the course, I've decided to start from the beginning to reinforce my knowledge. This approach aligns well with my concurrent pursuit of the Responsive Web Design Certification. I've estimated that I will complete the web design certification before moving on to the intermediate Python material, allowing me to focus fully on the Python course.

Speaking of the Web Design Certification, I successfully finished the Learn Basic CSS section of the certification. Initially, I underestimated the simplicity of this task, but I've come to appreciate the value of practicing even the basic concepts when learning a programming language. Despite considering myself more of a backend developer, I recognize the importance of taking HTML and CSS seriously, as proficiency in these areas enhances collaboration and communication with front-end developers.

Additionally, I delved into a PDF resource titled "12 Rules to Learn to Code." This reading provided valuable insights, such as the significance of the 20-minute rule, developing the habit of chunking, and the benefits of analyzing and debugging someone else's code. I highly recommend this resource, particularly to beginners and students. Moreover, I want to emphasize the importance of supplementing practical learning with reading books and watching coding videos. These additional sources have greatly contributed to my growth throughout the semester. Notably, CodeAesthetic's videos have been exceptionally beneficial to my learning journey.
