# Day 6: Starting the Review

## Reflection
 Today is a weekend, and I decided that I will dedicate most of my time to reviewing topics in preparation for the PhilNits Exam and my classes next semester during the weekends. I started by taking a past Philnits FE AM Exam, randomly selecting the 2017 version. Unfortunately, I scored only 25% (20 out of 80), which was quite disheartening. While I have prior knowledge of most computer science-related topics, I realized the need to review them thoroughly. Additionally, there were some management questions that I was clueless about, highlighting the importance of covering all aspects of the exam.

 To address this, I decided to begin my review with discrete math since it has been several years since I last studied it. Interestingly, I initially failed Discrete Math 2, but I managed to earn a 4.0 on my second attempt, which was just enough to qualify for a removal exam. Thankfully, I was able to pass the removal exam. This experience reminded me of the importance of perseverance and the possibility of overcoming past academic challenges.

 Moving on to my progress in the "100 Days of Python" challenge, Day 6 focused on functions and while loops. Although I understand how they work, I still need to familiarize myself with the syntax. Unfortunately, for this particular day, I didn't have any files to upload as the exercises were on Reeborg's World. Nevertheless, I was able to practice and reinforce my understanding of functions and while loops.

Conclusion

 Today's review session highlighted the need to revisit various topics, particularly Discrete Math, which I haven't touched upon in a long time. Considering the passing rate for the PhilNits Exam is around 30%, it is crucial to make an extra effort and start reviewing early, even if my plan is to take the exam in May or October 2024. Thankfully, I am currently highly motivated, and I have decided to exert more effort this school year. This first year of studying again from not studying anything for the past three years, was undeniably challenging, given my easily distracted nature and forgetfulness. With 94 days remaining, I am determined to make the most out of this challenge and achieve my goals.

## Progress
 - Took a preliminary exam before I started my review on PhilNits
 - Created a Reviewer and started reviewing logic gates
 - Completed Day 6 of 100 Days of Python
 - Progressed a little on the Introduction to Python Course by Sololearn
