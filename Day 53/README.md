# Day 53: Building My Fourth Capstone Project - Data Entry Job Automation

## Reflection

Today marks the beginning of another week. Lately, I've been facing challenges in completing the projects within a single day due to issues with my internet connection. Despite this hurdle, I'm dedicated to giving my best effort to complete the tasks as swiftly as possible.

In the "100 Days of Python" challenge, Day 53's lesson revolves around automating a research data entry job. This involves searching for house prices that meet specific criteria for a client on the Zillow website, and subsequently saving this data onto a Google spreadsheet. I've been able to apply the knowledge I've gained over the past few days, particularly in utilizing tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

Furthermore, I've made headway in the Responsive Web Design Certification. I've picked up where I left off, successfully completing the "Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine" section.

With this, I've concluded the web scraping segment of the "100 Days of Python" challenge. I'm eagerly anticipating the upcoming lessons and looking forward to the next 43 days of this enriching learning journey.
