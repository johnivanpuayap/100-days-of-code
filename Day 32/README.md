# Day 32: Sending Emails and CSS Mastery

## Reflection
  Today, I delved into Day 32 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, which covered intermediate+ level concepts. The focus was on using the Email SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) module and the datetime module to send emails. While the lesson itself was straightforward, I encountered an obstacle due to the course not being updated. Thankfully, I persevered and found a solution in StackOverflow: enabling 2-Factor Authentication and utilizing App passwords instead of enabling the less secure app access.
  
  This section presented an engaging exercise and an exciting final project. The exercise involved crafting a script to send motivational quotes via email on Mondays, providing a boost of inspiration to kickstart the week. Meanwhile, the final project centered around building an automated birthday wisher, ensuring heartfelt birthday messages are delivered seamlessly.

  Concluding the day's achievements, I successfully completed the "Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting" section of the Responsive Web Design Certification, which I had started yesterday.

  Only 68 days left on this challenging and fulfilling journey! As the countdown continues, I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills. There's still ample time to explore new concepts, tackle interesting projects, and elevate my programming prowess. Let's make the most of these remaining days!
