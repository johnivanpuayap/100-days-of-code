# Day 32:

## Reflection
  Today, I started by doing Day 32 of 100 Days of Python which is on the intermediate+ level actually. I learned about how to send email using the Email SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) module and the datetime module. While the lesson was easy, the main problem was that the course was not updated yet. Luckily, I was able to find a solution; you need to activate the 2-Factor Authentication and use App passwords now instead of enabling less secure app access.
  
  There is a one exercise and a final project for this section. The exercise is to create a script to send motivational quotes on mondays via email and the final project is creating an automated birthday wisher.

  I ended the day by finishing the Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting section of the Responsive Web Design Certification which I started yesterday.

  68 days to go!
