# Day 30: Exception Handling and JSON

## Reflection  
  Today, I started by completing Day 30 of 100 Days of Python. Here is a summary of what I learned today
  1. Exception Handling in Python, a concept I am already familiar with
  2. I learned that there is an else statement, which executes if there are no exceptions
  3. Raising Own Exception
  4. Opening and Saving data from/to a JSON

  I also managed to complete 2 exercises, add error handling on my Nato Alphabet project and was able to improve my Password Manager App by adding exception handling

## Progress
 - Completed Day 30 of 100 Days of Python
