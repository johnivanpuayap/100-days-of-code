# Day 49: Automating Job Applications with Selenium

## Reflection

On Day 49 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I dedicated my efforts to automating job applications on LinkedIn using Selenium.

Today's project presented several challenges. The most significant one was the sluggish internet connection, which prolonged the waiting time for page loading. This slowdown makes trying out and debugging the code much more tedious. Additionally, I encountered an issue where there was no available example job postings by Dr. Angela Yu to work with. Moreover, the job application process varied when using the 'Easy Apply' feature, adding complexity to the automation. Lastly, occasional captchas further complicated the process.

To address these challenges, I chose to automate two main tasks: following the company and saving job postings. This simplified approach ensures automation for each company, bypassing the intricacies of the application process. Additionally, I made sure to also search instead of just going to a specific link. This guarantees that the automation always starts with the most relevant job postings instead of the first job posting found on the link provided.

As it was a weekend, I concluded my coding session early to allocate time for reviewing in preparation for the upcoming PhilNits exam. With 51 more days left in this exciting challenge, I'm genuinely looking forward to continuing my journey of discovering new technologies and improving my skills in Python and web development.
