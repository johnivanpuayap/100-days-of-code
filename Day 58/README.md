# Day 58: Exploring Bootstrap and Tackling Coding Challenges

## Reflection

Over the past few days, I found myself unable to engage with the challenge once again. This was partly due to fatigue, illness, and the commencement of my classes. Looking ahead, I foresee that I may not consistently complete a day's worth of material in a single day or maintain a steady pace. Nevertheless, I had already anticipated this possibility and I remain committed to the challenge even if progression will be slower.

In today's session, we took a break from working on the blog capstone project to delve into Bootstrap, one of the most widely-used front-end toolkits. Additionally, the lesson covered wireframing, a concept I am already familiar with due to prior instruction in our class.

The day's culminating project involved creating a startup landing page for Tindog using Bootstrap. While working on it, I encountered some issues with certain utility classes not functioning as expected. However, I resolved these issues by consulting the documentation. Past experiences have taught me the importance of thoroughly reviewing documentation when facing difficulties, and I now make it a habit to do so.

Upon completing the lesson, I was still eager to continue learning. Consequently, I tackled two LeetCode questions: "Merge Strings Alternately" and "Greatest Common Divisor" as part of the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) study plan.

## Progress

- Completed Day 58 of 100 Days of Python
