# Day 24: Files, Directories, and Paths
## Reflection
  Today, I started working on Day 24 of the Python. After a couple of days, I am finally moving on creating games or using the turtle module, which is kind of a breath of a fresh air.
  
  I learned about working with local files and directories. I learned about how to read and write files on Python. I did many exercises today. The first one is improving the game and adding a high score. I thought that it was simple enough that I added other features like storing the top 5 scores and also letting the user store their name when they reach a top score. Next, I did the mail merge project, where I create a python program that allows you to automate sending a mail to different names, making it personalized.
  
  Conclusion

  Today, I ended my learning session early since my family wanted to go outside but nevertheless, I was still able to complete Day 24 where I managed to improve my Snake Game and complete the mail merge project. 76 more days to go
