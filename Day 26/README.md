# Day 26: List and Dictionary Comprehensions

## Reflection
  Today, I decided to revisit some topics from my previous semester and tackle two problems I couldn't complete during my Finals Lab Exam on Design and Analysis of Algorithm. The first challenge was Red Black Trees, and the second was Graphs using Adjacency List, in which I previously scored 90/100. Although it took some time to review these concepts and refresh my C++ syntax, I was able to solve it. I really am lucky to have tests provided by our professor. His class and lab activities have been instrumental in helping me grow and become better at coding.

  Afterward, I started Day 26 of the 100 Days of Python challenge. I learned about list comprehensions, a unique and powerful feature in Python, and also explored dictionary comprehensions. I successfully completed five exercises today, but I encountered a subtle error in Exercise 3 that wasn't covered in the solution. The readlines() function returns strings, including the newline character (\n) if there is a next line. However, for the last line, the newline character is absent. To address this, I used list comprehension to remove the "\n" by using strip() before performing comparisons.
  
  The final project of the day involved creating a simple program that converts a user-entered word into a list of its corresponding NATO Alphabet.

  Overall, it was a rewarding day, and I'm happy with my progress. Only 84 days left in the 100 Days of Python challenge, and I'm looking forward to more learning and coding ahead!
