# Day 25: Resolving my Finals Lab Exam

## Reflection
  Today, Since I was still trying to organize my codes from the previous semester. I actually decided to try to solve 2 of the 5 problems I wasn't able to complete on my Finals Lab Exam on Design and Analysis of Algorithm. I am trying to solve the red black trees part which I skipped due to lack of time and complete the Graphs using Adjacency List part wherein I only got 90/100. Coding this actually took some time since I needed to review a bit of the Red Black Trees and Graphs with Adjacency list and also touch up my C++ syntax. Nevertheless, I am honestly lucky that I can check if it works since our professor actually went and created tests, this is why I honestly like his class and it is also because of his lab activities that I was able to grow and become better at coding (I am still mediocre though).

  After that, I went on and started doing the Day 26 lesson. On this lesson, I learned how to create lists using list comprehensions. and how to use dictionary comprehension. The final project for todays lesson is
