# Day 26: List and Dictionary Comprehensions

## Reflection
  Today, Since I was still trying to organize my codes from the previous semester. I actually decided to try to solve 2 of the 5 problems I wasn't able to complete on my Finals Lab Exam on Design and Analysis of Algorithm. I am trying to solve the red black trees part which I skipped due to lack of time and complete the Graphs using Adjacency List part wherein I only got 90/100. Coding this actually took some time since I needed to review a bit of the Red Black Trees and Graphs with Adjacency list and also touch up my C++ syntax. Nevertheless, I am honestly lucky that I can check if it works since our professor actually went and created tests, this is why I honestly like his class and it is also because of his lab activities that I was able to grow and become better at coding (I am still mediocre though).

  After that, I went on and started doing Day 26 of 100 Days of Python. On this lesson, I learned how to create lists using list comprehensions where is actually pretty unique in Python and also how to use dictionary comprehension. I finished 5 exercises today where I actually find an error in Exercise 3 that was not covered in the solution. Basically, the readlines() will return a string and also including the "\n" if there is still a next line so it looks like this for example "1\n" but if it the last line that string would be "1" since there is no next line, hence you need to use list comprehension to loop from the readlines() to get rid of the "\n" before you compare it.
  
  The final project today is about the NATO Alphabet.
