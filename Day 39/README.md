# Day 39: Building a Cheap Flight Finder App

## Reflection
  On Day 39, I took on an exciting challenge by starting the first part of the fourth capstone project - developing a Cheap Flight Finder app. Throughout the day, I delved into the world of APIs, integrating key technologies like Sheety API, Tequila Flight Search API, and Twilio SMS API to craft this powerful flight search tool.

  Despite having to end the day's coding session early due to personal matters, I feel enthusiastic about the progress I made with the Cheap Flight Finder app, and I'm eager to continue refining it in the coming days. Working with APIs provided valuable experience, and I'm excited to see the final product and confident that this project will further enhance my Python skills. 61 days to go!
