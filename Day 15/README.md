# Day 15: Coming Back From Vacation
## Reflection
  Today was the first day I am doing this again from a vacation. Honestly, it was hard getting started and I had no energy but what I honestly just did was turn on the computer and do nothing and just wait till I got bored and just learning. Once I started, it was already smooth sailing and I was able to go and be motivated again.

  I started by doing the Python Intermediate Course by Sololearn where the topic is dictionaries. I already learned about dictionaries on Day 9, so it was honestly sort of like a review of my knowledge. What I did learn on this was that Only immutable objects can be used as keys to dictionaries and also that when there is two arguments in a get function of a dictionary, the first number will be the key and if they do not found a value with the associated key, the second number will be returned.

  After, I started doing Day 16 of 100 Days of Python, this section covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. I already know about OOP and I actually have a certificate in Java OOP since our school required us to take it. I also learned about Python packages, learned how to use PyPi, a repository of software for the Python programming language and learned how to use pip to install packages in the command line as well as in Pycharm. The final project of this section was the same as the Day 15 Section which is the Coffee Machine project but we have to use OOP this time around.
  
  Here is how I did the project:
